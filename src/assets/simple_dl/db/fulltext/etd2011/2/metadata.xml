through convenient Web browsers as prior publications  This has been a topic of discussion for well over a decade in the ETD community  not only of concern to graduate schools and libraries but also among research faculty and their graduate students  At the same time that a growing number of universities worldwide are requiring ETDs and making the research and scholarship of their graduate students publicly available  many faculty advise their students to restrict online access to their theses and dissertations due to concerns about future publication options  This paper reports on the 2011 survey results of journal editors  and university press directors  attitudes toward online theses and dissertations  This data and the open ended comments from the survey respondents indicate support for open access to ETDs  Keywords  Journals  presses  open access  graduate students   INTRODUCTION Why do another survey   Data on this topic is  for the most part  dated  Publishers were previously surveyed a decade ago by two of the authors of this paper  In 1999 Joan Dalton was on a research leave when she conducted the first known survey specifically investigating publishers  attitudes towards ETDs   Dalton 2000  She surveyed publishers in the sciences  Nancy Seamans  2000 survey focused on the social sciences   McMillan 2001  Seamans 2003  Dalton Seamans 2004  Two years later  Bobby Holt surveyed humanities publishers   Holt 2002  Seamans and Holt built on the foundation that Dalton laid  adapting her survey instrument   DLA Survey  The current survey was also conducted because questions continue to arise as evidenced by the recent discussion on the ETD L  listserv  and articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education  We also have evidence that authors are restricting access to their ETDs and that university faculty are advising students to restrict access due to concern about publishers  perceptions about prior publication  There is very little data on the topic of publishers  attitudes about ETDs  Most of the information resources are based on perceptions of publishers  attitudes  and these perceptions are contradicted by the contemporary data as well as that from a decade ago  For example  the Virginia Tech graduate student exit survey  at the conclusion of the ETD submission process   has gathered data for over a decade  The question relevant to this paper is   If you restricted access to your ETD  what did you base your decision on    DLA Survey  Similarly  in 2002 Ursula Goldsmith s survey of the Louisiana State University faculty became part of her dissertation   Goldsmith 2002  More recently  in 2009 Angela McCutcheon surveyed graduate school personnel about the impact of publishers  policies on ETDs   McCutcheon 2010  During discussions at the June 2010 meeting of the Board of Directors of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   Seamans volunteered to  move a publisher survey forward    NDLTD 2010  Therefore  we conducted a survey to gather contemporary data for presentation to the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  and the associated NDLTD Board of Directors meeting   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   McMillan et al   2011 NDTLD Publishers  Survey  Deciding who to survey   We purchased the most current available data from Thompson Reuter s Journal Performance Indicators  JPI   2005 2009  The JPI index had 81subject categories with  7 000 journal titles in the Social Sciences and Humanities  Specifically  there were 55 categories in the Social Sciences Index and 27 in the Arts and Humanities Index  The data included RPI  Relative Impact Factors  a measure reflecting the average number of citations to articles in a journal  It can be an indicator of the relative importance of a journal within its field  We sorted the data sort on RPI  and selected the top 10 journal titles in each category  located editorial contact information  and removed duplicates  journal titles  editors  etc    The resulting list of 616 was comprised of about two thirds social science and one third in the humanities journals  By surveying academic presses we thought we could add another important perspective on attitudes towards ETDs  Fortunately  Brenna McLaughlin  the Electronic and Strategic Initiatives Director at American Association of University Presses  AAUP   agreed to email our request for survey participants to its 130 members  Rather than having a subject focus  the university press s mission is to  publish work of scholarly  intellectual  or creative merit      AAUP 2011  How and when were they surveyed   We used SurveyMonkey  a Web survey tool  to distribute the survey to 616 journal editors  The email invitations included a brief description of the goals of the survey  a link to the online survey  and the endorsement of the NDLTD executive director  Ed Fox  The survey was open May 17th   June 16th  2011  The 130 AAUP members received the same email request on May 19th  Subject  Are Electronic Theses prior publications  In the U S  and around the world  Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETDs  are becoming increasingly available through online digital repositories  As an academic editor or publisher  would you consider an ETD to have been previously published  Would your journal or publishing enterprise consider accepting a manuscript submission derived from an electronic dissertation  You are invited to complete a brief  11 question  survey on how the academic publishing community views ETDs  Your participation will comprise a valued contribution to the growing conversation about academic publishing in the digital environment  WHAT QUESTIONS DID WE ASK IN THE SURVEY   There were 11 questions that collected information on prior publication policies among scholarly academic publishers  Nine of the questions had to do with characteristics of the survey respondents including the nature of the enterprise  e g   university press or journal   subjects covered by the enterprise s publications  size of the enterprise  and the like  The key question was  Which of the following statements best reflects the editorial policy or practice governing your enterprise   Manuscripts which are revisions derived from openly accessible electronic theses or dissertations  ETDs  are       Always welcome for submission   Considered on a case by case basis   Considered ONLY IF the contents and conclusions in the manuscript are substantially different from the ETD   Considered ONLY IF the ETD has access limited to the campus or institution where it was completed   Not considered under any circumstances   Other WHO RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY   We had a 17  response rate  75 journal editors and 53 university press directors  The most common subjects covered by the university presses included  History  Environmental Studies  Literary Theory   Criticism  Religion  Political Science  Humanities  Multidisciplinary  Anthropology  and Women s Studies  Journal subjects were more scattered  with Interdisciplinary Social Sciences being the most common  This suggests that we reached a broad audience of Humanities Social Science journal editors and university press directors   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   McMillan et al   2011 NDTLD Publishers  Survey  2011 NDLTD PUBLISHERS  SURVEY FINDINGS  The following survey findings  data and comments from 128 survey respondents  reveals the policies and practices among journal editors and university press directors  and their attitudes towards online theses and dissertations   Nearly three fourths of the survey respondents said ETDs  are welcome for submission   Almost half  always  welcome them and more than a quarter considered them  on a case by case basis   Limiting access to the host university community does not affect a significant number  Less than 3  of the survey respondents consider ETDs for publication based on this criterion  A very small number do not consider publishing ETDs under any circumstances  What is the perspective of university press directors who publish primarily monographs   Fifty three AAUP members responded  representing North American academic presses  the majority of which  61   publish monographs  Of these respondents  34  indicated that a manuscript derived from a publicly accessible ETD may have barriers to publication  but working through them with the editor could mitigate these impediments  Over half of the respondents indicated that manuscripts derived from online theses and dissertations would either be welcomed for publication or considered on a case by case basis  It was a commonly held expectation among the survey respondents that revisions to the original thesis or dissertation would have been undertaken prior to submission for consideration  Just over half  52 2   of the directors of university presses comments had to do with their willingness to consider ETDs that had been revised  For example   We normally consider theses or dissertation for publication only if the author is willing to revise them for a broader audience  this is our practice regardless of the availability of an ETD   Another commented   We ask authors to stop distribution of their ETD when we agree to publish their REVISED material   And   Some manuscripts  even if published electronically as dissertations  are appealing regardless of their electronic availability because the audience for them in print form is substantial enough that it does not matter   What is the perspective of journal editors   As expected  more journals have adopted the practice of accepting and publishing ETD based submissions than monographs  as is reflected in the acceptance level of manuscripts derived from ETDs  Of 128 respondents  69 indicated  journal  was their enterprise  Of these enterprises  a full 84  indicated that manuscripts derived from openly accessible ETDs would either be welcomed for publication or considered on a case by case basis  As with monographs  it was commonly expected that substantial revisions would be undertaken for a journal article submission   This is not so black and white  These are always welcome for submission but a journal article is not going to take the same form as a thesis or dissertation  if it tries  it won t pass peer review   Many institutions have provided the option to limit ETD access to the current university community  This was largely provided to appease journal publishers who were opposed to online theses and dissertations  However  the current survey reveals that restricted access is not necessary  To wit  none of the journal editor respondents indicated that ETDs could be considered  only if the ETD has access limited to the campus or institution where it was completed   Only 3  of the journals would not consider such a submission under any circumstances  less than half the number of presses  The results look quite different when we look at overall survey responses and then separately at university press directors  and journal editors  responses   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   McMillan et al   2011 NDTLD Publishers  Survey  Journal editors are more enthusiastic about receiving submissions based on ETDs than are university presses  Two thirds of the journals  always welcome  submissions from ETDs  while one tenth of the university presses do  This is not to say the university presses discourage submissions based on ETDs  Nearly half consider ETD based submissions on a case by case basis  Slightly more than one quarter  26 8   will consider submissions  ONLY IF the contents and conclusions in the manuscript are substantially different from the ETD   There does not appear to be a significant relationship between the size of the enterprise and its policy or perspective on accepting manuscripts derived from ETDs  However  university presses are about two and a half times as likely to  never  accept ETD based submissions  than are journal editors  Only university presses find access restrictions necessary  How do 2011 findings compare to previous surveys   Not a lot of change overall has taken place in publishers  attitudes towards ETDs in 10 years  In addition  this years survey results from Social Science and Humanities publishers align with past surveys of other disciplines including the Sciences  A relative few would not consider an ETD based submission under any circumstances  Fewer publishers find access restrictions a determining factor when deciding to publish a book or an article from an ETD  More importantly  twice as many respondents indicated that they require the ETD to be  substantially  different from the original work  What doesn t the data say  Comments on the Prior Publication Question  In addition to the data  university press directors  comments are very telling  Nearly half of our survey respondents volunteered additional comments and observations with us  and supplied their names and email addresses so that we could follow up with them  Comments in favor of ETDs largely represented two categories   1  Editors and press directors judge the quality of the article or book submitted for publication  and  2  ETDs are not considered published works   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   McMillan et al   2011 NDTLD Publishers  Survey  Quality is Key   The American Psychological Association  which publishes over 40 journals across psychology  has an official policy that theses dissertations  even if archived at a university site  are not counted as prior publication    A journal article is qualitatively different from a thesis  and must be structured with the needs of quite different readers in mind  All our submissions are subject to peer review  and frequently papers change in response to reviewer feedback  The fact that a paper grows out from an academic thesis is not a concern for this journal    Prior availability through an IR is not usually the deciding factor  We are more interested in the quality of the work  how well it fits with our list  and whether it deserves wider dissemination and promotion   Not Prior Publication   We do not consider the dissertation to be the equivalent of a book  It is student work  a book is professional work    Dissertations have  never  counted as publications    A pdf of an unpublished work is still an unpublished work   2009 DATA FROM NORTH AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES  There is one additional source of evidence about publishers  attitudes towards ETDs  In Angela McCutcheon s 2010 Ohio University ETD   Impact of Publishers  Policy on ETD Distribution Options within the United States   she wrote about her survey of graduate school personnel at North American universities  The purpose of this study was to determine if large circulation journal and book publishers were rejecting articles submitted for publication because the submitted articles books were derived from ETDs    She surveyed graduate school personnel at hundreds of North American universities and found only a very few  1 8   publishers had out right rejected manuscripts on the basis of their being derived from ETDs  NEW CONCERNS ABOUT ETDS  ETDs make author anonymity difficult  Among the survey respondents  general comments we learned one survey respondent pointed out a previously unconsidered problem  The one problem this creates  which I and the editorial board have not resolved  is that this makes anonymity in review difficulty easy to determine who the author is  and thus undermines the strength and reliability of peer review  This could  ultimately  disadvantage young scholars  So we may change our policy and not allow submission of manuscripts based on dissertations that are freely accessible  We were also reminded that not all publishers are familiar with the issues surrounding publications derived from ETDs  My first thought on this matter  and I never thought about it until just now  was  why should anything derived from a dissertation be excluded    but thinking further  if dissertations can be as readily accessed by computer as is becoming the case with journals  then perhaps I need to consider some form of restriction  The purpose of a journal is to present original information and knowledge  or as near original as possible  If dissertations become as accessible as journal articles  than  sic  perhaps I should adopt a policy that precludes articles drawn from dissertations  This comment may well indicate that either the publishers are out of touch with authors  concerns  or it hasn t been brought up as an issue by their authors or editors  Very few editors or directors seem to be aware that ETDs are also beginning to include published articles  We would prefer that students work with their major advisors to design thesis  sic  chapters for submission as research articles and review papers as part of the dissertation process to ensure a good fit with the journal  Ideally  the dissertation when completed will contain chapters that have already been published or accepted for publication so that the journal does not have to compete with content that is already freely available  ADVICE TO GRADUATE STUDENTS BASED ON THE 2011 PUBLISHERS  SURVEY  Other than the surveys reported here and those conducted a decade ago by Dalton  Seamans  and Holt  here is very little data on the topic of publishers  attitudes about ETDs  Most of the information on this topic relies on perceptions of publishers  attitudes  The contemporary data as well as that from a decade ago contradict these perceptions  Graduate students should not hesitate to submit works  e g   journal articles and monographs  based their ETDs to the top journals and academic presses  Ninety six percent of the publishers will consider them  Quality is the publishers  main concern  They are looking for authors who will adapt their ETDs for new audiences including peer reviewers  Based on the survey responses  ETDs are unsuitable in their original formats  e g   too long  Instead  the ideas can be reused  but Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   McMillan et al   2011 NDTLD Publishers  Survey  they need to be reformatted to fit the publishers  guidelines and target audience  Two key insights can be gleaned from the 2011 NDLTD survey of journal editors and university press directors  Based on their responses   1  it is absolutely necessary to revise an ETD  in whole or in parts  in order to be considered for publication   2  Quality was a common concern by respondents  not public accessibility to online theses or dissertations  An overwhelming majority  96   of the university press and journal respondents indicated that ETD based works would be eligible for consideration in their publications   REFERENCES  1   Dalton  Joan  2000  ETDs  A Survey of Editors and Publishers  3rd International Symposium on Electronic Theses and
