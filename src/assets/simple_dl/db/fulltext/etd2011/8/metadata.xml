libraries usually receive these publications which they index into their respective online catalogues  To trace these documents therefore it will require visiting numerous catalogues of the various universities  This practice wastes a lot of time and often never exhaustive  it limits access and visibility of Kenyan scholarly output  In order to increase visibility these publications need to be indexed into a form that is harvestable into a major search engines or repositories  Some universities are now establishing institutional repositories  IRs  for their publications which will include theses and dissertations  However without a unified system of indexing it will always be a challenge to comprehensively search for scholarly output form Kenyan universities  It is for this reason that a national electronic theses and dissertation  ETD  repository is highly advocated  The rate of scholarly publications is steadily rising as compared to a few years ago  Prior to 2009 a list of theses and dissertations produced by Kenya Information Preservation Society  KIPS  had just over 12 000 publications that had cumulated over the years in the libraries from 12 universities and 8 research institutions  Significant growth can be marked by the statistics from two major universities   University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University   that have a combined average of over 2000 theses per year  The increase can be attributed to three main factors as outlined below  First is the gradual rise in number of universities  Second is the increase of approved graduate courses and finally the higher number of students graduating   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Thuku  Towards National ETD Database  Responsibilities for Libraries in Kenya  Number of Universities in Kenya  In the last ten years  the number of universities in Kenya has more than doubled  According to the Economic Survey reports of 2005 and 2010  the universities increased from 15 in 2000 to 31 in 2009  see Table 1 below   The current status of recognized universities stands at 50  http   www che or ke status html

 Number of Universities in Kenya Post Graduate Programmes  Almost all the universities in Kenya offer post graduate courses  The directory of approved programmes offered in Kenyan Universities  CHE  2008  lists 17 masters and 8 PhD programmes  Some of the programmes were being offered in 5 or more institutions  thus the Doctor of Philosophy  5   Master of Education  7   Master of Business Administration  8   Master of Science  11  and Master of Arts  14   This scenario justifies the need for a national theses and dissertation repository for consultation before any new research is undertaken  It will minimize possible duplications  Number of Graduating Students  Graduating students directly impact the number of theses and dissertations since they are responsible for their publication  University of Nairobi leads in student enrollment at graduate studies followed by Kenyatta University  Recent statistics show a steady rise of graduating students as shown in Table 2

University  RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIBRARIES  University libraries are required to organize and make accessible not only books and other materials acquired but also theses  dissertations and other publications from the institution  Apart from the traditional indexing practices it is expected that libraries should innovatively adapt new technologies in meeting their role of facilitating access and custodians of information  Therefore librarians  as experts in collection development  information storage  cataloguing and dissemination  should take leadership role in management of information in any format   print  digital or otherwise   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Thuku  Towards National ETD Database  Responsibilities for Libraries in Kenya    Genoni  P  2004  observes that technology is changing how researchers create  communicate  preserved and communicate new knowledge  Many avenues exist and may present difficulty in controlling new knowledge  However libraries should provide stewardship in planning and building institutional repositories that encourage researchers deposit new information  Librarian should thereafter facilitate access through established indexing services and repositories that enhance visibility  For a long time  librarians have been aware that no library can be self sufficient and have always established or joined consortiums to enhance access and delivery of information  In recognizing that theses and dissertations are unique scholarly research and intellectual output  libraries within the country should work closely in harnessing these precious national information by establishing a national repository that will not only register all publication but also facilitate visibility  Further  collaboration with national establishments such as Kenya Education Network  KENET  that is responsible for interconnection among tertiary institutions and management of local content should be encouraged  INAR MODEL FOR ETD MANAGEMENT  INAR is institutional  national and African based repository which is a 3 tier hierarchal model for the management of theses and dissertations emanating from universities and research institutions in Africa  In this model the institutional repositories  IR  are at the bottom  then the National ETDs in the middle and finally the regional DATAD database at the top level  Repository unit established at any level has defined processes and conforms to international standards particularly for maintaining the ETDs metadata  All units are interrelated and can share data and information across and within each level  The overall aim is to comprehensively acquire  organize  store  conserve  disseminate and monitor use of scholarly publications of theses and dissertations emanating from Africa  Illustration of this concept is shown in figure I below  Three Tier Repository Model  Regional  Africa   DATAD Repository  Headquarters at AAU   National Repository A  IR  I  National Repository B  National National Repository C  IR  II  IR  III  Institutional  Figure I  Three Tier INAR Model  In this approach  individual repositories are independent information systems with specific goals and have inputs  processes and outputs  A common goal at all levels is to update metadata of ETDs  Ideally the input of metadata should be done at the bottom level in the institutional repository before it is harvested into the national repository  At this stage data is verified and modified to meet the requirements of DATAD database before uploading at the top level  This is the best and most efficient practice  However  because institutions have different priorities  capacities and competences the ideal may not work  In some  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Thuku  Towards National ETD Database  Responsibilities for Libraries in Kenya  circumstances the National Repository may have to input metadata from source  Whatever the approach librarians  who are the experts in information organization  should take leadership in the process  A common concern at the institution is where the full text ETDs are to be stored  There are three options available  First  the institutions are custodians having developed their own IR policies  The ETD metadata is passed on to the national repository before dispatch to DATAD  This is quite acceptable  Second option is where the national repository takes the responsibility for acquisition  organization  storage and facilitates access  This is the most efficient and suitable method  Lastly  ETDs are managed at DATAD headquarters  Obvious benefits include experience  access to suitable equipment  advocacy and sustainable budget   Role of National Repository in Implementing INAR Model  The national repository is crucial in implementing INAR model  Its primary roles will be    Maintain record of all theses and dissertations produced in the country    Provide a single reference tool to scholarly research in the country    Play advocacy roles towards establishment of IR    Train and steer the development of IRs at all levels    Ensure that the ETD metadata conforms to the acceptable international standards    Facilitate assignment of Digital Object Identifier  DOI  to ETDs    Collaborate with national and regional services that work towards visibility and accessibility to scholarly work   CONCLUSION  The need for controlling scholarly research from Kenyan universities is very critical in order to comprehensively conserve and increase visibility and provide researchers with a reliable and convenient repository  Individual universities are encouraged to establish institutional repositories that incorporates ETDs and links up with national repository that ensures quality indexing and enhances visibility in the African region and globally  The institutional  national and African based repository proposed here promises better and sustainable system   REFERENCES   ENSURE THAT ALL REFERENCES
