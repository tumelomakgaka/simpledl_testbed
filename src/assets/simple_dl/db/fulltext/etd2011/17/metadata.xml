Karin DeJager uct ac za Annah Macha uct ac za  ABSTRACT  The growth of open access institutional repositories has been remarkable in South Africa  Increasing numbers of institutions in South Africa are starting to implement digital institutional repositories in order to collect  disseminate  manage  preserve  and index the research output created by their communities  For a university  this would include materials such as scholarly publications  before  pre prints  and after  post prints  undergoing peer review  and digital versions of theses and dissertations  The Repository might also include special materials such as digital assets generated by and donated to an institution  such as art and a wide range of other image collections  Once digital materials are accepted by an Institutional Repository  the Repository should be able to guarantee access and preservation of the digital data  South Africa at present has twenty three Institutional Repositories  The leading example is the University of Pretoria  which helped the Council of Science and Industrial Research to establish its repository in 2007  Other universities are benchmarking from it This paper will compare the Institutional Repository at University of Pretoria with the development of new Institutional Repository at the University of Cape Town In Pretoria  it was found that for an establishment and implementation to be successful  it depends on a number of factors that will be considered and discussed  An analysis of interviews with key informants from the University of Cape Town will be used to assess the extent to which the Institutional Repository at University of Cape Town is dealing with the identified issues  The paper will critically discuss the importance and benefits of having an Institutional Repository and explore what the University of Pretoria is doing to produce a successful repository  Keywords  Digital libraries  institutional repository  open access  scholarly publishing in South Africa  INTRODUCTION  The establishment and development of institutional repositories are gaining momentum in South Africa  SA   In many institutions  there are documents which need to be preserved  managed  as well as shared and that is one of the main reasons for establishing an institutional repository in academic libraries  Other reasons for the establishment of an institutional repository are because it would help to preserve the institution s intellectual property and increase the institution s visibility and prestige  It also acts as an advertisement for funding sources and industrial sponsors  Prosser  2003 168   According to Prosser  an institutional repository provides  a central archive of a researcher s work  it increases its dissemination and potentially  its impact on the research community and it may act as researchers  Curriculum Vitae as all their output is gathered in one place   2003  168   Not only does the institution and the individual benefit from the establishment of an institutional repository  society may also benefit as it provides access to an institution s research and ensures its long term preservation  Prosser  2003 168   This paper will explore the developments towards the establishment and implementation of an institutional repository at the University of Cape Town  UCT  and will compare this with the institutional repository at the University of Pretoria  UP  which has established itself as a pioneer and a leader in the development and management of scholarly repositories in South  Proceedings of

comparative overview  Africa  Gray  2009   OVERVIEW OF SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIES  The inaugural meeting of the Academy of Science of South Africa  ASSAf  Journal Editors  Forum that took place in late July 2007  marked the beginning of South African initiatives towards open access movement  ASSAF website   A national research and development strategy for South Africa had been published in 2002  Pienaar and Van Deventer  2008   which invited all stakeholders to reconsider and look into the renewal of the information services sector  This brought about the South African Research Information Services  SARIS  Project which investigated ways in which South African research institutes and university libraries would access the world research literature  It was recommended that a framework for eResearch services to the entire South African research community should be created  Organisations such as Electronic Information for Libraries  eIFL  and the Mellon Foundation provided assistance to universities with funding for starting up institutional repository projects  eIFL is an independent foundation that strives to lead  negotiate  support and advocate for the wide availability of electronic resources to enable and sustain access to knowledge by library users in developing countries  These two organizations  initiative helped to establish of a number of university institutional repositories in South Africa  TOWARDS DEVELOPING AN INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN  The Manuscripts and Archives Department of the University of Cape Town Libraries began digitizing selected material in 2001  Dunlop and Hart  2005   It was a small scale project  based on the unique collection of records about the San people  It involved the digitization of 310 photographs taken by Dorothea Bleek between 1910 and the late 1920s  It is one of the most important collections at UCT which attracts researchers from all over the world  It has also been listed on UNESCO s Memory of the World register as documentary heritage of international importance and that is why the department started this digitization project  Dunlop and Hart  2005   During the project  the staff at Manuscripts and Archives followed international guidelines and benchmarks regarding capture parameters and type of metadata  They also attended workshops given by Digital Imaging South Africa  DISA  which were helpful in giving them an overview of the processes and of the practical implications of undertaking a digital imaging project  Dunlop and Hart  2005   Other digitization projects that followed were instigated by individual departments  Computer Science started in 2003 to digitize theses and dissertations by the students in their department  The LawSpace Digital Subject repository was started in 2005  digitizing theses and dissertations of the students in the faculty of Law  Currently there are four different departments with repositories in UCT  1  2  3  4   Faculty of Law   UCT LawSpace Department of Computer Science   UCT Computer Science Research Document Archive Department of Manuscripts and of Archives in the Library Open Educational Resources   UCT   Open Content is not a repository but a directory for educational materials  It is the web portal for accessing open teaching and learning content from UCT  It is produced by the Open Educational Resources  OER  project in the Centre for Educational Technology at UCT  The directory aims to display the teaching materials of UCT academics and to encourage the publication of open educational resources   While investigating the already functional departmental digital repositories  it became clear that there were plans to bring together the four departments and that a new UCT Institutional Repository was envisaged in the library  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY IN THE UCT LIBRARIES  Interviews were carried out to understand why the digital initiatives at the UCT Libraries were conducted at a relatively small scale in the early 2000s  Two reasons that were identified were cost and staff resources  Firstly  it was realized that establishing an institutional repository needed a budget for staffing  and for hardware and software to start up the project  Secondly  appropriately trained members of staff were required  From around 2006  the Executive Director of UCT Libraries repeatedly requested the University to budget for the implementation of an institutional repository  The deans and other members of the executive were supportive  but according to the Executive Director  in a highly competitive fiscal environment  this request always came closely behind higher priorities  In September 2009 the Executive Director submitted the UCT Libraries  strategic plan and priorities for years 2010 2014 to the University Senate outlining in detail the plans of the libraries for the next five years  This document explains the impact that a Carnegie Grant had on the establishment of the UCT Institutional Repository   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  In 2005  the Carnegie Corporation of New York had awarded the UCT Library  together with the libraries at the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Kwa Zulu Natal  a grant amount of  2 5 million  This was for a three year project directed at supporting research and library staff development at these institutions  Rapp  2009   Among other projects this grant provided funds to develop a new Digital Initiatives Unit with up to date equipment and expert staffing  The Unit is in charge of spearheading the establishment of the Institutional Repository  which is intended to be launched in October 2011  The Digitization Unit  by establishing an institutional repository  is implementing two of the UCT Libraries strategic plans and priorities  stating that the Unit will   Attract  preserve  digitize  and make available via a sophisticated web portal  key African archival and other resources  Digitize these resources as a contribution to African scholarship  as an incentive for digital collaboration on the continent  and as a showcase for UCT s research presence    Rapp  2009  2  The institutional repository will therefore  a    provide a web based presence for UCT s collections and make them available to scholars in Africa and elsewhere  b  enhance UCT s research presence on the web  and c  enable better preservation of the primary physical resources    Rapp  2009  6  According to the UCT Libraries  strategic plan and priorities for the years 2010 2014  the Libraries will aim to   Strengthen the Special Collections and Digitization Units to attract additional heritage collections and to enhance capacity to digitize special collections and research materials  In particular  focus on providing adequate and appropriate space and added curatorial expertise in specialized materials  such as film  video  photographs  and music    Rapp  2009  6  The Carnegie funding therefore played a major role in establishing the Institutional Repository at the University of Cape Town  enabling for example the purchase of equipment such as scanners and cameras and the DigiTool software  The contents of the UCT repository at present is divided into three categories  digital collections  finding aids and theses and dissertations  It consists mainly of material from the old digitization projects that took place from 2001  combined with the new contents digitized by Digital Initiatives Unit since its inception to date  Digital collections in the new institutional repository have a total of 1891materials as last updated on the 30 th June 2011  It includes  Under exposed  materials which is an in depth and special digital collection of photography  showcasing different twentieth and twenty first century photographers  work  including both the pre and post apartheid periods in South Africa  There is the  Varsity   which refers to the UCT student newspaper from the 1900s   Sax appeal  covers show all the annual UCT Remember And Give  RAG  club Magazine covers from 1933 to date  The  Percival Kirby collection  from 1887 1970 is a large collection of images of musical instruments made and played by indigenous Southern African groups compiled by Professor Kirby   UCT through the years  is another collection which dates back from 1900 to the present and is a collection of photographs from the 1900s of the Groote Schuur campus to the present UCT in 2011   British concentration camps  is a collection about the concentration camps  which were formed by the British army to house the residents of the two Boer republics and the Orange Free State   The San  photographs by Dorothea Bleek is a collection of 310 photographs from 1910 1920s   Black Sash  is a collection of National Conference Papers on Black Sash minutes   The Center for Popular Memory  has a collection of articles for center for popular memory and some on Islamic faith healing documents and interviews  Finding aids consists of 866 materials  as last updated on the 30th June 2011 The collection is arranged in alphabetical order by categories  A  Finding Aid  is an inventory of an archival collection  and provides detailed information about the content  arrangement  and context of a collection  DigiTool website  2011   These include   South African College UCT  which is a collection of documents and minutes of the history and events about UCT from the 1900 to date   Architectural Collections  consists of papers  architectural drawings  photograph albums  press cutting books  pamphlets  pictures and sketches   San people  is a collection of original documents on  Bushman  and  Bantu  philology and folklore   Political Collection  contains documents and newspaper clippings on political issues in the 1940s about organizations and political parties  labour and trade unions and church unions and the formation of churches and associated politics  Theses and dissertations is a collection of Masters and PhD student theses and dissertations  The UCT Institutional Repository at present has a total of 1099 theses and dissertations as last updated on 30 June 2011 from the six different faculties in UCT  Humanities  Science  Heath Sciences  Engineering  Commerce and Law dating from 2008 to 2010  The Institutional Repository can be found under the UCT library website  under the name DigiTool  the URL is http   www digitool uct ac za   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  A DESCRIPTION OF UP ELECTRONIC THESIS AND DISSERTATIONS REPOSITORY  UP started making theses available online in the year 2000 as a pilot project  UPeTD website   Shortly afterwards the library was tasked with establishing an Institutional Repository for which the open access ETD db software was used  At the end of 2002 the repository contained 39 theses and 26 dissertations and in 2003 a policy was adopted by Senate to make submission compulsory and a new server was bought  In 2004 UPeTD expanded in order to create a repository which was meant especially for research collections based on the success of UPeTD  which had provided PhD students according to Gray  2009  with research visibility and had contributed to their career success as their work was being read and downloaded  The management of the UP Institutional Repository soon discovered that the Institutional Repository needed full time clerical staff  In 2006  UP established yet another Institutional Repository for the management and dissemination of digital research materials donated to or created by the community publications and for their special collections known as UPSpace  UP also has OpenUP which is a sub collection of the larger UPSpace collection  Pienaar and Van Deventer  2008   According to Olivier  2010   this  repository collection offers open access to full text of research articles published by staff  students and affiliates of the University of Pretoria   OpenUP houses e prints  of peer reviewed and published research articles  UP Website   In total UP has two repositories  UPeTD and UPSpace while OpenUP is part of UPSpace  Olivier  2010   Olivier  2010  further states that OpenUP offers authors two routes of publishing their research output which are  Open Access selfarchiving which is known as the green route whereby authors submit their post prints to the repository  and Open Access publishing which is known as the gold route whereby authors publish in open access journals  UP became a member of the international body the Networked Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   which provides access to all the world s theses and dissertations and which hold annual conferences  It also rewards eTDs that use technology in innovative ways  UP has contributed to nine workshops in South Africa  Botswana  Lesotho  Ghana and Ethiopia  sharing expertise and enthusiasm and helping colleagues to start their own operations  They assisted the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research  CSIR  to develop a digital repository  Pienaar and Van Deventer  2007   UPeTD was also the subject of seven conference presentations at ETD  open scholarship and library quality conferences  This indicates that to a considerable extent it is the leading university in SA in this field  UPeTD website celebration of 10 yrs   A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE UP AND UCT INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIE  A detailed comparative analysis of UCT and UP will be discussed  UP was chosen for the comparative analysis based on its well established repositories and their successful implementation  When planning and deciding to establish an institutional repository  certain decisions and minimum requirements need to be taken into account  The decisions include   How will the repository effort be staffed and funded  who will manage it  what platforms will be used  what initial policies will be made known and what marketing techniques will be used  Essentially these are the minimum required to get a repository up and running   Nabe  2010 13  Below are some of the factors that UP has identified which may be taken into consideration when setting up an institutional repository  Smith   Pienaar  2007   1   Identify important role players  In order to establish an institutional repository at UP  the major role players had to be identified  These included  the head of the Department of Information Science  subject librarians who were comfortable with new innovative tools  a metadata specialist  a digitization specialist and IT staff   Smith   Pienaar  2007   At UCT the main role player is the Head of the Digitization Unit who spearheads the UCT Institutional Repository project  Her role is that of project manager thus the Institutional Repository champion  and various staff members  such as subject librarians and metadata specialists  support her  2   Address issues of resources  At UP  issues of resources were addressed by conducting a survey of available funds and other resources  Findings from the original survey showed that they had a suitable server  they had some funds to start the project  they also had enthusiastic staff who believed in the project  and they had support from the library management  specifically the Assistant Director of eInformation Strategy   Knowledge Management  They therefore went ahead with the project  At UCT Libraries  the project originated from a small scale project in 2001  which digitized uniquely African material  For this project  UCT libraries had their own funds  A lack of resources delayed the implementation and establishment of an Institutional Repository at the time  In 2009  UCT Libraries obtained funding from the Carnegie Foundation to support research in the library  when they began to set up an Institutional Repository  which is still under way  The intention is that it  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  will be launched in September early October 2011  According to Nabe  2010   most of the funding for institutional repositories comes from the institutions and in some cases institutional repositories have been successful in receiving grants from organizations  This is what happened with the UCT institutional repository establishment  3   Evaluate software  Both open source software and proprietary software are available for institutional repositories  It is important for an institution to choose software based on its need  At UP  it was decided to choose open source software and open standards based on the UP IT framework  The open source software chosen was ETD db software developed by researchers at Virginia Tech for their theses and dissertation repository  Pienaar and Van Deventer  2008   In 2004  the UP digital repository project team evaluated  over a six month period  several open source and commercial software platforms such as Greenstone  Innovative  Fedora  E prints  DSpace  and I Tor for their UPSpace repository as the eTD used ETD db  DSpace was eventually chosen because it fitted the UP IT architecture and supported a distributed approach to an institutional digital repository  Pienaar and Van Deventer  2008   At UCT  an extensive evaluation of available software for both open source and proprietary software was conducted in 2009  The evaluation assessed what software other universities nationally and internationally had chosen for their institutional repositories  It was found that nationally  most institutions had chosen either DSpace  an open source solution  or EPrints  which is also open source software  Internationally  DSpace was the open source software package of choice  while ContentDM and Luna Imaging were the proprietary packages of choice  UCT Digital Initiatives Unit conducted an evaluation of the four major software solutions  namely DSpace  EPrints  ContentDM and DigiTool  Omeka is another software package that was also evaluated but was discarded as it was not yet widely used  The findings were that DSpace and EPrints were good solutions for non visual materials or text based materials  but not for visual material  like images  It was also found out that it was possible to customize the look and feel of the interface on both packages  although there was yet no instance where this had worked effectively  ContentDm and DigiTool were very similar in functionality and price  DigiTool was finally selected  as it is a reputable  vendor supported tool  adopted by many major universities and the UCT library had a long standing relationship with Ex Libris  the company that created DigiTool  It was also thought that the library did not have the capacity or did not wish to develop local expertise to sustain and maintain the installation of DSpace and EPrints  DigiTool would integrate well with the UCT online catalogue and UCT portal  PRIMO by Ex Libris  the new search interface  to be launched in September early October 2011  Ever since UCT Digital Initiatives Unit started using DigiTool  it has made major strides in content deposits  In addition to the reasons above  DigiTool offered UCT ongoing technical support in the form of a contract with Ex Libris  After evaluating various institutional repository platform options it was found out that DSpace did not adequately address the visual aspects of the UCT Institutional Repository  as photographs and other visual material are not displayed in a satisfactory manner in open source software such as DSpace or EPrints  It is important to note that DigiTool can support open access as it is an OAI   PMH  Open Archives Initiatives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  complaint enterprise solution for academic libraries and research institutions  Stevenson and Hodges  2007   DigiTool was designed for creating  managing  preserving and sharing digital collections  It also supports Dublin core  The Ex Libris website states that  the open access platform also facilitates the sharing of scholarly information in a library s user community by integrating digital collections with institutional portals  e learning systems  and other library systems    Ex Libris website  2011   Even though it is proprietary software  it therefore meets the needs and requirements of open access  UCT Institutional Repository will be an open access initiative in spite of being based on proprietary software  4   Policy for the Institutional Repository  The need for a policy to guide the operation of the repository is an important factor to be considered  Issues such as what to accept or decline  copyright issues  self or mediated archiving  submission and withdrawal policies  types of materials to accept  and other issues governing the operation of the institutional repository form part of the policy of an institutional repository  Asamoah Hassan  2010   These aspects would need to be discussed and agreed upon by the institutional repository project committees  The policy should clearly indicate whether the repository is an open access initiative  and whether it would include abstracts as well as full text publications  The Deutsche Initiative for Networked Information  DINI  recommends that repositories should make policies and make them available to everyone specifying how they will be run and what their content will be  DINI  2011   The policy must also specify the rights and obligations of repository operators and of authors editors  At UP the Institutional Repository is governed by a policy which has been approved by the University  and is managed by the Institutional Repository team consisting of the University Librarian  the Systems Librarian and the Institutional Repository Librarian  Smith   Pienaar  2007   UCT has a policy for the submission of print and electronic theses  in addition to that it  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  has guidelines for students on how to submit their theses and dissertations  but not yet an overall institutional repository policy statement  5   Restructuring the library to accommodate change  The UP library management accommodated the repository by generating new roles and responsibilities during the implementation of their digital repository  In 2007 they had approximately 18 subject librarians who were involved as collection administrators  A total of 12 cataloguers who were involved as metadata editors and nine faculty library leaders fulfilled the roles of collection managers  Smith   Pienaar  2007   Involvement in repository activities are part of the official role description of their cataloguers and subject librarians  and their performance is also monitored on the performance management system  To remove any possible uncertainty amongst role players  each role was clearly defined and communicated  and certain responsibilities were assigned to these roles so that all were familiar with exactly what was expected of them  Smith   Pienaar  2007   UCT Library management is in the process of restructuring roles and responsibilities of its staff in order to accommodate the change that will be brought about by the establishment of the Institutional Repository  Existing staff members will be offered new roles and new staff will be hired for new roles  6   Licensing  In order to ensure open access to its collection  Stevenson   Hodges  2007  state that an institutional repository needs to be registered with open access harvesters such as OAISTER  the Registry of Open Access Repositories  ROAR   Open DOAR and Google Scholar in order to be harvested by these search engines  UP is registered with the ROAR  openDOAR  Google and as a publisher at Google Scholar  and registered with the DSpace community  After setting up the Institutional Repository  the project manager in UCT would also need to register with open access harvesters such as those noted above  Licensing is what the DINI refers to as visibility of the service  A repository must have an entire range of services  which are available via a website  The Institutional Repository s homepage must be accessible from a central location on the institution s homepage  According to the DINI criteria an Institutional Repository has to be visible not only to the immediate and individual user but also to external services such as search engines or other referencing services so that it can be visible to the whole world  2011   In addition to registering with the search engines it must also be registered and listed on the DINI website  Even though a repository can be harvested by providing OAI PMH interface  it is still important to register repositories as it is a useful means of promoting the visibility of repositories to service providers for harvesting  The Open Archives Initiative provides a service allowing repositories to be registered as a data provider in the OAI registry  JISC Repository Net   CRITERIA FOR A SUCCESSFUL REPOSITORY  The criteria for the success of an institutional repository would normally be taken from its statement of purpose  An institutional repository can only be said to be successful if it fulfills its stated purpose  which includes to  preserve information and make it available for a designated community   Thibodeau  2007  1   Another important factor to note when judging the success of an institutional repository is the context  or purpose it serves and the environment in which it operates  Thibodeau  2007  is of the view that  the metrics for estimating success against the criteria must be formulated in light of the culture  constraints and opportunities existing in the environment   2007 1   Below is a discussion of some of the criteria that have been identified with which to determine success of an institutional repository  DINI and DRIVER  Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research  discussed other pointers and criteria for success of institutional repositories  DINI noted eight which are visibility of the service  policy  support of authors and publishers legal aspects  information security  indexing and interfaces  access statistics  and long term availability  DRIVER proposes guidelines which focus on five issues  collections  metadata  implementation of OAI PMH  best practices  and vocabularies and semantics  It is concerned with textual resources that can be harvested with OAI PMH  DRIVER  2008  This is because the major resource type provided by digital repositories is text and the major approach for offering these textual resources is the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  The DINI Certificate provides a solid basis for what to consider when operating a repository  Since DRIVER looks at repositories from the perspective of an aggregator  the DRIVER Guidelines do not cover the aspects described in the DINI Certificate that are designed for guiding the overall local operation of a repository  DRIVER  2008   Below is a discussion of some of the criteria that have been identified with which to determine success of an institutional repository some of which do have both the DINI criteria embedded in them and the DRIVER guidelines   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  1   Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  Content  The content of an institutional repository is the most important factor that has been cited by researchers to show the success of a repository  Organ and Deveson  2010  Thomas  2007  Markey et al   2009   Contents must be secured in order to be considered successful by the organisations or funders and other stakeholders  Markey et al   2009  are of the view that not many researchers yet agree on what criteria to use to judge a successful repository but what seems to be clear is that content recruitment is an important factor to show whether the institutional repository is successful  Content recruitment is key because it literally is the core of the institutional repository  A critical mass of material is necessary to generate both additional content and end user activity  Value added services in the institutional repository are also seen as an important part of success  These include everything from full text retrieval to preservation  Markey et al   2009   The contents of an institutional repository should include both born digital and the older repurposed digital materials  and Westell  2006  argues that there should be more  born digital  materials in an Institutional Repository than repurposed materials  According to Westell  2006  216    the larger the critical mass of documents in an Institutional Repository  the more it will facilitate output measures   This means that if a repository has a lot of content then it will stand a higher chance of being visible to the outside community and the more it will be used  hence its citation rate will go up  Long term availability is a further criterion found in the DINI certificate and it can be discussed or embedded under the content factor  how the repository intends preserving these contents for future use  A DINI minimum requirement is that a document should at least be archived in a repository for no less than five years  According to Olivier  2010  UPeTD has a total of 5693 materials  UCT currently has 4786 as updated on 30 June 2011 even though it has not yet been officially launched  Digitool website   2   Use  Use is the second factor that has been identified as a success factor and can be divided into three sub categories  number of users  type of content used and nature of use  Harnad and McGovern  2009   The most widely used method to measure the use of a repository is by webometrics  According to Organ  2006  and Thomas  2007   webometrics is the statistical technique of counting the gross number of items in the live repository and to measure retrieval for counting hits and downloads with the option to sort by country   Webometrics show how many hits have been made from the repository and how many articles have been downloaded  The more the downloads  the clearer it becomes that the institutional repository is being used  To the researchers whose papers are downloaded  it may mean that they are likely to receive more citations  Westell  2006  notes that statistics of this sort contribute to institutional research outcomes and are powerful data to be used for individual career progress  As research outputs are increasingly exposed to the web via search engines such as Google  organisations will be looking at and making use of institutional repository statistical packages  According to Organ  2006   high citation rates of researchers  work in various institutions make vice chancellors and CEOs accept these new kinds of research infrastructure  with the promise of improving and enhancing the reputation of their institution and research staff  In addition  bringing together input data  usage and citation analysis is helpful in giving the picture of how effective a repository is  These data give evidence that the institutional repository is being used by a variety of users and provide benchmarks of use and growth over time for institutional repository funders and university administrators   Westell  2006   According to DINI  the factor of use  which is measured by webometrics  is similar to its criterion access statistics  which looks at access statistics of documents and their publication rate for the qualitative  quantitative and technological evaluation of the repository  DINI  2011   Therefore  every repository must log statistical data and this can be achieved by a tracking system of downloads and citations  This is similar to Bibliometrics and in websites it is called webometrics  At UP Electronic Theses and Dissertations  4317706 files were downloaded in 2009 and regular messages were received from users testifying to the usefulness of the system  UPeTD website   A survey done by Hammes  2007  also indicated that the ETD is appreciated by its alumni PhD students who were experiencing rewards in their careers because the ETD had made their theses visible  At UCT  an interview with the LawSpace repository manager stated that the Faculty of Law receives emails from people outside the country who use and appreciate the LawSpace repository  and ask why recent student theses have not been uploaded yet  According to the Head of the Digitization Unit  the UCT Institutional Repository intends to track its use through the daily downloads and hits  3   Submission  The rate and number of submissions which lead to growth of the repository are the third factor to consider in judging if the  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  repository is a success  These are referred to as the  repository deposit activity measures   Thomas  2007   This means that  sustainable repositories are only possible with sustainable deposit profiles through active community engagement   Carr and Brody  2007  18   A repository should have regular deposits that are broken down to daily deposits so that they may be spread across the institution and in that way the Institutional Repository is sustained  Institutional Repositories should avoid occasional huge deposits  as Thomas  2007   who quoted Carr and Brody  2007  proposed that  regular but less high volume inputs are a preferred way to sustain Institutional Repositories  describing it as the difference between the  gappy  and continuous deposit profile   Carr and Brody  2007  propose the use of the Registry Service ROAR  Registry of Open Access Repositories  to examine the performance of repositories according to the daily activity of any of its repositories  This factor of submission of deposits can also be sub divided into categories  Number of submissions refers to the digital content that is deposited in the institutional repository  It can be a high or low number of submissions  Frequency of submissions refers to deposits being made in a continuously  As noted above it is recommended that submissions should be continuous over time not just large deposits occasionally  Type of submitter refers to the people who deposit contents in the Institutional Repository  They range from staff  to graduate students and undergraduate students  Researchers advocate for a broad representation of constituents in the institutional repository in a university  all departments should submit content  Participation of key stakeholders refers to participants as university administrators and funders  where they too submit contents in the Institutional Repository  Harnad and McGovern  2009   At UP  a policy was adopted by Senate in 2003 to make submission of research output compulsory  The UP Senate voted for a mandate for deposits and this is a sign that there is top level support for the institutional repository establishment  Gray  2009   At UCT the Library policy deals with submission of electronic theses and dissertations and digital collections  It is compulsory for students to hand in a digital copy of their thesis in the form of a CD ROM so that they could be uploaded into DigiTool  A policy regarding submission and deposits into the UCT institutional repository will still have to be formulated  approved and then passed on to the UCT Senate for final approval before the institutional repository can use it  4   Advocacy  Advocacy is the fourth success factor to be considered  Advocacy deals with building an informed awareness for which a core message and ethos are essential  In order to ensure that the message of Open Access and the benefits of establishing and managing institutional repositories is spread as effectively as possible  staff members need to create a communication plan for the advocacy campaign  A number of different advocacy strategies can be used  including top down and bottom up  blanket and targeted approaches  DRIVER  2008   This can be done by using informational web sites  promotional brochures and presentations to departments  Westell  2006  calls this promotion  he argues that a repository must be promoted to faculty staff in order for them to change their attitudes towards open access publishing  as it may be a new concept to them  Promotion is an important factor that can help populate the institutional repository once academics understand the changing culture of scholarly communications  The literature shows that the project known as Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access  SHERPA   which was set up in the United Kingdom  UK  mainly to inspire change  after helping UK universities to establish and implement institutional repositories  then ventured in advocacy projects  This was because many academic libraries in the UK had implemented institutional repositories and it was time to advocate for their use  Markland and Brophy  2005  are of the view that for an institutional repository to be successful  cultural change must be achieved through advocacy or  getting the right message to the right people with the tone and content varied by audience   Johnson  2007  23   Though the institutional repository may have funding  staffing  fundamental values and policies  it still needs advocacy  SHERPA observed that neglecting advocacy resulted in repository decline and stagnation but  with the right level of engagement across the institution  advocacy became the key to success  Johnson  2008  24  is of the view that  advocacy is a route to achieve the crucial goal  real cultural change   This requires widespread engagement with academics  but time and effort are also needed  With regard to advocacy  UP formed a campus committee whose mandate was to create a framework within which the university policy  and guidelines and resources were made accessible to students  teaching staff and administrators  In order to make the university community of UP aware of the existence of the ETD  a web site was created  brochures produced  and regular anti plagiarism campaigns organized and held  UPeTD website   UCT has not yet reached this stage  the institutional repository is still in its infancy and it is suggested that marketing plans will be put in place and executed in preparation for the launch  5   Support  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  Support is the fifth factor to consider in judging the success of an institutional repository  without support from the university community and the stakeholders then the institutional repository will never be successful  Support comes in three forms  which are  Constituent support   The community that the institutional repository serves should support it  Content depositors should be willing to deposit their work without being persuaded first  Users too should express their satisfaction with the institutional repository by giving institutional repository feedback through blogs or emails  Financial support   is important for the setting up and maintenance cost while the institutional repository is running  The institution can provide ongoing  and preferably increasing support or the institutional repository may have funding from outside international organizations  Technical support   when setting up repositories it requires technical help and support  Thus  the initial set up of an institutional repository requires a mixture of library and IT skills  and these are not always in place   Markland and Brophy  2005  13   There should be adequate support for and interest in the development and enhancement of the institutional repository infrastructure  the necessary software and tools are required   Harnad and McGovern  2009   Staff needs to be trained in order for them to work effectively and efficiently  The Senate in UP voted to mandate for deposits and that is a sign that there is top level support for the establishment of institutional repository  Gray  2009   This is a sign of constituent support the very significant support that UPeTD gets from the University Senate  This means the institutional repository largely relies on mandates  This was supported by Harnad and McGovern  2009  28  who stated that  mandates provide the only means for achieving a successful institutional repository   as UP also demonstrated  At UCT in 2009 the library obtained funding from Carnegie Corporation to support research initiatives  This funding helped UCT to start setting up the institutional repository and to purchase the DigiTool software  6   Influence  Influence refers to providing assistance to other institutions in establishing their own institutional repositories  This is similar to what Thibodeau  2006  calls collaboration  and it is about how the institutional repository associates with others in the country  region and in the world  Repositories are encouraged to work in collaboration with others to demonstrate that they are successful  If an institutional repository works in isolation  it might signify failure because it does not share and transfer knowledge  A more collaborative arrangement would exist where separate institutions decide to work together to leverage each other s strengths and where they form or join consortia for such purposes  Thibodeau  2006   This is already happening at UP which  is actively involved in helping other institutions set up their institutional repositories  It assisted CSIR and expressed interest in working with and helping the Southern African Regional Universities Association  SARUA  representatives who visited them in 2007  Though the UCT institutional repository has not yet been launched  it is already very active in supporting other institutions who wish to learn about the theory and practice of digitization  The Head of the Digitization Unit has delivered workshops to librarians and archivists  for example the Kimberley Digitization Workshop and the Digitization Workshop for Library of Parliament librarians  Here in UCT she is teaching digitization to Post Graduate Diploma and Honours students in Library and Information Studies  The UCT institutional repository staff have also advised various departments on campus  on metadata standards and the implementation of good metadata practice  7   Interoperability  Lastly  an institutional repository should be interoperable  which refers to the capability of a computer hardware or software system to communicate and work effectively with another systems in the exchange of data  usually a system of a different type  designed and produced by a different vendor  Reitz  2006   Interoperability can be achieved by being OAIster compatible  this means that institutional repositories must be accepted by standards provided by the Open Access Initiatives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  OAI PMH   These standards create interoperability  connecting distant institutional repository content through search engine capabilities  Without adhering to these standards  content searchability is limited and only accessible to community members who are locally aware of specific content  Westel  2006  states that interoperability indicates openness on behalf of the institution or the library which is willing to contribute to national and international scholarship  The importance of interoperability is that OAI and other search engines such as Google Scholar can harvest their contents and in that it is advantageous to producers of repository contents thus researchers and authors as it exposes scholarship in a new way and puts it in an international context  The repository may be the only vehicle to distribute this material  Westel  2006   A major success factor therefore is to meet the universal standards of OAI PMH in order to make content more  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  accessible  Carpenter  2008   According to Nabe  2010 30   metadata also plays a role in the systems interoperability  This means that for digital repositories to achieve interoperability and to exchange digital objects between them  they firstly need to provide data and or metadata to their partners which they can understand   To achieve this  the parties need to agree on the structure  the syntax and the semantics of the data and or metadata objects  and they need to either comply with common formats or to provide a means for metadata mapping and or for object conversion   Aschenbrenner   Kaiser  2005  25   The common format for repositories is the one proposed by OAI which is the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  OAI PMH  and for OAI compliance a repository must expose and allow dissemination of unqualified Dublin Core Metadata  The Dublin Core  DC  metadata schema is defined as the minimum standard to allow interoperability between repositories  This schema contains 15 elements defined by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative  Aschenbrenner   Kaiser  2005   There are three types of metadata  namely descriptive  administrative and structural  Descriptive metadata has basic information about a resource such as creator s name  title  subject content  description and publisher  The way this information is presented depends on the metadata standards being used  Dublin Core is compliant with OAI   PMH harvesting and all institutional repository solutions which use Dublin Core as their metadata standard are compatible with OAI  Metadata is also important in supporting repository management such as administration and preservation  Aschenbrenner   Kaiser  2005   OAI PMH is one of the mechanisms used to achieve interoperability between digital repositories  JISC Repository Net   It provides a system to facilitate the harvesting  sharing and discovery of distributed resources  This allows materials within repositories to be accessed by a greater number of users via external services  In addition  data harvested via OAI PMH is now being used for a range of other repository applications such as reporting  enhanced user interfaces for direct searching of local repositories  and assisting with the ingest of data into other systems  JISC Repository Net   A CRITICAL SUMMARY DISCUSSING UP AS A BENCHMARK AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR UCT From the comparison between institutional repositories at UP and UCT it is clear that although both institutions have repositories  they are not the same  Firstly  one can look at the differences between how UP and UCT s repositories started  UPs first repository was mainly to house electronic theses and dissertations  ETD  and later UP established two other repositories for research output for the institutions  academic community  UPSpace and Open UP respectively  UCT s repository does not primarily focus on electronic theses and dissertations  but it is for all the institutional digital objects including research output  such as research papers  data sets  images  digital collections  and also electronic theses and dissertations  At the moment UCT institutional repository mainly focuses on special collections and heritage collections found in South Africa  It has one of its image collections listed under UNESCO S Memory of the World register as documentary heritage of international importance  The UCT Libraries strategic plan for the years 2010 2014 also shows that the repository s main focus is on   Strengthening the Special Collections and Digitization Units to attract additional heritage collections and to enhance capacity to digitize special collections and research materials  In particular  focus on providing adequate and appropriate space and added curatorial expertise in specialized materials  such as film  video  photographs  and music   Secondly  one can also look at the different types of software that each repository chose  UP choose open source while UCT choose proprietary software mainly because it was looking at its contents which will be dominated by images  so they wanted software that displays images clearly  which proprietary provided  while open source software could not  Photographs and other visual material are not displayed in a satisfactory manner in open source software such as DSpace or EPrints  DSpace  which does not provide the same visual impact as products as DigiTool or ContentDM  The main difference is that on open source software one does not get a visual overview of the photographic collections  as one would get with proprietary software  Thirdly  UP can be taken as a benchmark by other institutions including UCT because of the success of its electronic theses and dissertations repository  It among the early institutions in South Africa to set up a repository and helped those institutions that needed help  It set itself as a good example when it came to establishing institutional repository in the country and held workshops and seminars to influence other research institutions to follow in the movement of open access and scholarly publishing  CONCLUSION This paper gave a comparative overview of the establishment of the UCT institutional repository and that of UP  highlighting the factors to consider when establishing an institutional repository  It showed that UCT started its repository after UP and the advantage is that it is now able to benchmark from the most well established institutional repository in SA   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Macha  and De Jager  Two South African Institutional Repositories  a comparative overview  Criteria for a successful institutional repository have also been discussed in order to show what needs to be done for an institutional repository to be successful and valuable to its stakeholders and all its users  It has been shown that institutional repositories can play an important part in a university as they collect and store all the university s research output  thus helping with its preservation and archiving  Institutional repositories are also important in enhancing the visibility of an institution in Africa and the world   REFERENCES  1   Asamoah Hassan  H  2010  Alternative scholarly communication  management issues in a Ghanaian university  Library Management  31  6   420 426
