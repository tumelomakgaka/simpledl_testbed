cyber4ac yahoo com  acorletey lib knust edu gh ABSTRACT  In 2008  the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology  KNUST  implemented the first Institutional Repository in Ghana  Six month later and with 560 postgraduate theses entered  KNUST appeared 52nd on the webometrics ranking for 100 best universities in Africa  This success resulted in the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Ghana  CARLIGH  and International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publication  INASP  helping four academic institutions to implement repositories  The repositories  managers promised using it to showcase research from their institutions  starting with graduate theses dissertations  Aims  This paper looks at how these repositories have met the challenges of technical support  content provision  qualified personnel  institutional backing  achievements and lessons for other institution thinking IRs Method  In depth interviews  observations  checks from the websites  reports and secondary documents obtained from the Libraries were used to collect data for the paper  Result  All four institutions had problems with their repositories  While two were completely out  two were uploading some content but their platform was only visible within the library  The absence of policy legalizing the operation of the repositories made it difficult for the managers to request for equipment  content and qualified staff to run the repositories  Useful recommendations are made for CARLIGH  INASP and other bodies that seek to support such enterprise with resources  Keywords  Institutional repositories  Electronic theses  Ghana  Open access  Knowledge sharing   INTRODUCTION  Knowledge has always been created based on the experience and information available  The researcher always researches into the unknown but initiates the process by considering the available facts and  or knowledge  Ngulube  2007  asserts that  scholars use research findings to generate further research  models and archetypes   Thus findings accruing from research should be made available for others to build upon and for the society to gain from  Institutional Repository has been hailed by many authors as a step in the right direction to aid the dissemination of such local research findings to the local community where the research was carried out  and for whom the findings will be more relevant  Prosser  2003  posits that  IRs provide a means for institutions to create archives and make available their wealth of knowledge   Shearer  2003  adds that  IRs provide access to scholarly material without the economic barriers that currently exist in scholarly publishing   The implication is that while IRs will provide open access to knowledge  it will also bypass the subscription problems that many researchers face on the African continent  This restriction has led in part to the dearth of research findings emanating from the African continent and available for the African scientist  Gutam et al   2010  state that  research output published in peerreviewed journals is not able to reach other peer groups working in the same field in India and the world   This has led to the duplication of effort and several attempts at re inventing the wheel instead of making it run more smoothly by improving upon the already existing knowledge  It was in this light of making such research findings available to the research community of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in particular and the country in general that the Library set out to establish an institutional repository  The effort resulted in the creation of a platform for the wider dissemination of the research findings coming out of the University  But many more benefits were added than was bargained for  The impact was felt even outside the walls of the  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Corletey  Institutional repositories for open access  The Ghanaian experience  university as it greatly improved the standing of the university among the international web rankings  This egged on some other academic institutions within the country to set up their own repositories  To move them from being isolated islands of knowledge to a globally connected and unified source of information  these institutions sought help from the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Ghana   CARLIGH   CARLIGH had been in the lead negotiating access to electronic resources for its members and getting support for training programs to enhance the professionalism of the staff of member institutions  CARLIGH with support from the International Network for Availability of Scientific Publication   INASP  enlisted the help of a Systems Analyst to set up institutional repositories and provide training for the institutions  The installation and training program went smoothly in spite of some hitches that came up  And all the platforms were running at the time of handover  What is the situation presently  What are the challenges  What are the achievements  Are there any lessons to be learnt  The paper reports the challenges from the set up stages to the present and provides useful lessons for others in the process of replicating the efforts   THE INSTITUTIONS  The four institutions that benefitted from the initiative are listed below  The first two are all Public funded institutions  the third is public and self sustaining financially  the fourth is a private institution owned by the Methodist Church  Ghana 1  2  3  4   University of Cape Coast  Ghana  UCC  University of Education  Winneba  Ghana  UEW  Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration   GIMPA  Methodist University College  Ghana   MUCG   Of these institutions only GIMPA and MUCG could acquire brand new servers to be used for setting up their repositories  These two had no back up servers to fall on  in the event of their new servers malfunctioning  All the four institutions had problems with bandwidth  All the libraries lacked public IP addresses to allow them to be live on the Internet with their research content  There was no existing institutional policy to give legal backing and budgetary support  considering the fact that the IR operation will involve some running cost  GIMPA and UEW Libraries had a staff each with some level of IT expertise to act as technical support staff  All the libraries had some collection of theses dissertations resulting from the research carried out by students in their institutions  But these were hard copies   UNIVERSITY OF CAPE COAST  UCC   The University of Cape Coast  one of the rare sea front universities in the world was established in October  1962 as a University College  The College attained the status of a full University on October 1  1971  with the authority to confer degrees  diplomas and certificates by an Act of Parliament   The University of Cape Coast Act  1971  Act 390  and subsequently the University of Cape Coast Law  1992  PNDC Law 278   Its original mandate was to train graduate professional teachers for Ghana s second cycle institutions and the Ministry of Education  in order to meet the manpower needs of the country s accelerated educational programme at the time  Today  there is diversification of programmes  From an initial student enrolment of 155 in 1963  the University of Cape Coast now has a total student population of over 35 922  The breakdown is as follows  14 815 Regular Undergraduate Students  2 146 Sandwich Students and 18 018 Distant Learning Students  The University of Cape Coast admitted a total of 4 251 students into its various programmes for the 2009 2010 Academic Year  These were selected from a total of 11 730 candidates who applied for admission to the University  The server for the UCC crashed barely a week after setting up the platform  This was an old server that was not being used  Coupled with this was a fire outbreak at the Network Operation Centre  NOC  of UCC  The effect was that the repository became almost  still born   The public procurement act of the country leaves the minimum time to acquire a good server at three calendar months because of the price tag  The challenge was when the University was to re tool the UCC NOC and also get a new server for the library  Fortunately the presence of a young and talented National Service Personnel   whom the Library rightfully retained through employment   was to say the least very instrumental in turning the tables around  Although having his first degree in the arts he was very talented in IT  This person  revived  the old server and used the set up instruction left behind installed a more  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Corletey  Institutional repositories for open access  The Ghanaian experience  current version of the platform than was previously installed  Uploading of the theses content began again but access is restricted to within the library  Although the University has provided a new server and restored the services of the NOC  the repository still lacks a public IP address  There are about 436 full text theses dissertations on the platform  and more are being added daily  The issue of copyright has not been resolved and there is no policy in place to govern the operations of the repository   UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION  WINNEBA  UEW   The UEW was originally established by PNDC Law 322  1992  as the University College of Education of Winneba  UCEW  through the amalgamation of seven diploma awarding institutions and later became the University of Education  Winneba by Act 2004  Act 672 on May 14  2004  The University was charged with the responsibility of producing professional educators who will spearhead a new national vision of education aimed at redirecting Ghana s efforts along the path of rapid economic and social development  The mission is to train competent professional teachers for all levels of education as well as conduct research  disseminate knowledge and contribute to educational policy and development The situation here has not been different from that of UCC  An old server that was used crashed and has not been revived nor replaced  The IT personnel at the IR section have been rescheduled to another office  The platform is not operational and institutional repository service is clearly suspended  The library still has no public IP address  Interestingly the UEW Library has pushed through with their policy and is now at the final stage seeking approval from the Academic Board for implementation  The repository manager has also been working on the side to advocate the submission of electronic copies of theses alongside the hard copies  The response from the graduate students has been welcoming  The library now has in its possession some theses dissertations which will be used as the foundation when the platform goes live again It is not known when the service will be revived  but it is hoped that very soon the academic board will give its assent to the policy and make it binding on the institution  When this is done the repository will be in a position to request for a new server  the services of qualified IT personnel and make it mandatory for the students to submit soft copies of their theses to the library for uploading to the repository  This line of action in getting the policy in force before the platform should have been the first line of action   GHANA INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  GIMPA   Named the Institute of Public Administration  GIMPA was established in 1961 as a joint Ghana Government United Nations  UN  special fund project to develop the public administrative system  and produce civil servants with administrative and professional competence  At the end of the joint project the UN handed the Institute to the Government of Ghana and was then re designated Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration in 1969 to reflect its expanded functions  Over 49 years  five successive mandates have been enacted to guide GIMPA s activities with the last being the GIMPA Act  2004  Act 676   Today  as an independent public tertiary institution GIMPA offers training in Leadership  Management and Administration  Policy Analysis  Consultancy and Research  Distance Learning  Gender and Development programmes  GIMPA has contributed to the national development efforts by building the much needed capacity development  The repository at GIMPA has also been very successful  The copyright of the theses dissertation from the institution by default belongs to the institution  Thus students have no rights over theses dissertations they submit as part of the requirement for the award of their degrees  This arrangement has been beneficial to the repository since it has taken out the copyright problem and aided the uploading of theses dissertations unto the repository  GIMPA does not have a public IP and so access is restricted to the confines of the library  There is a talented young man who is IT inclined and who has been providing wonderful support  The repository has over 300 theses dissertations currently on display mostly from the undergraduate and sandwich programs and a few postgraduate ones  The other challenge is that the Repository Server is located in a library room where all appliances are shut down at the close of work  thus restricting access to the platform to between the working hours  that is if it even operates  There is no policy in place to guide the operation of the repository   METHODIST UNIVERSITY COLLEGE  GHANA  MUCG   The Methodist University College Ghana  MUCG  was granted accreditation by the National Accreditation Board in August   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Corletey  Institutional repositories for open access  The Ghanaian experience  2000  Its application for affiliation to the University of Ghana was approved in October  2002  MUCG started academic work in October  2000  The first batch of students reported for lectures in November  2000  The College is in its eight academic year  Student enrollment has grown from 213 students in 2000  to a total number of 3743 students at the end of the 2008 2009 academic year  That was made up of 1 872 males and 1 871 females a 50 50 male female ratio showing good gender balance  Although some abstracts of postgraduate theses have been loaded onto the repository  it is not running smoothly and the server was actually shut down at the time of the research interview  One big challenge comes from the fact that the library is located outside the main campus and does not have a direct network connection to the NOC at the main campus  Although the library has access to the internet it does not have a public IP address to allow it to host the repository  This arrangement does not allow the library to display what is available on the platform to the entire community  and the repository is only available to users within the library premises  The Library does not also receive soft copies of the theses dissertation and since it does not have a scanner to convert the theses to electronic form it is impossible to have the theses on the repository at present  A policy to govern the operations is still lacking though there are some efforts at putting one in place that has not been achieved  Advocacy has not made much impact and more needs to be done to improve the consciousness of the faculty and students as well as the administration   Observations  The following challenges seem to be recurring in all the libraries       All the libraries had a problem getting public IP addresses so the platform could be seen on the internet  This meant that they could not be seen on the Internet  All lacked mail server services which made it impossible to allow others to register apart from the administrators who were added at the time of setting up the platforms  This was because their Internet Service Providers   ISPs  were either unable to provide them with mail services or unwilling to do so for free  Locating the repository platform in the libraries did not help much in the provision of a 24 7 service to the community  This was because the servers were shut down at the close of the day s work along with all other electronic electrical equipment as a rule  This defeats the purpose of providing greater access and impact through the platform  Involving the staff of NOC of the institutions help gained their confidence and support for the platform  and they had since provided support as best possible to the platforms   Another observation was that the Libraries that had people other than core IT graduates working as IT support staff fared better although other problems had prevented their platform from being visible   RECOMMENDATIONS  Experiences from the four institutions show that the lack of a clearly defined policy governing the operations of the repository is greatly affecting the operations of the platforms  and making it difficult to get full and committed support from their authorities  From these experiences  institutions that seek to set up repositories are strongly encouraged to begin their preparations by drafting a comprehensive policy that will cover the operations of the repository  As soon as the draft policy is ready  it should be submitted to the authorities for approval  Such a policy should be pushed through for approval and acceptance from the administration to get them fully committed to the operations of the repository  This will support request for the purchase of needed equipment and other things that will be necessary for the smooth running of the repository  The policy should among others include a clear statement on the following areas  1  2   3   An introductory statement on the objectives of the policy itself and indicate the scope of coverage The objectives of the Institutional Repository and its benefits  The scope of coverage should also be stated  i e  the items to be held in the repository  Information on benefits of the IR to the institution  the faculty and other staff  students  and the country at large available from the repository project site  http   rsp ac uk  and the webometrics world of university rankings  http   www webometrics info  A clear statement on who constitutes the stakeholders   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Corletey  Institutional repositories for open access  The Ghanaian experience  4   The formation of a management committee to oversee the implementation of the policy  If possible the head of institution or his deputy should be chairing that body   Specific meeting times should be indicated for the committee  e g  have monthly or quarterly meetings  5  A request for at least one IT support staff  This should preferably be a non core IT person  The experience shows that core IT persons have a high turnover rate  It should be a person with a keen interest in IT and who can do some level of  tweaking  and  scripting  of computer programs   A library could also look internally to see if any of its staff could be further trained to take up that responsibility  6  A clear statement on the equipment required to run the platform  This should include at least two new servers  one high end and a medium end server  The mid end server will provide back up if the main server fails  A book scanner and at least one computer  If two servers cannot be purchased at the same time  arrangements to purchase the second one should begin immediately after the acquisition of the first one to avoid undue delays 7  A clear statement indicating that the repository server should be provided with a public IP address and a dedicated bandwidth so that users can access it easily  The server should also not be a shared one   i e  have other programs running on the server  8  That the servers should be provided with adequate security against both hackers and virus attacks  The importance for a backup of the records offsite should be clearly stated  9  A statement on the location of the repository server  It is suggested that this be located at the Network Operation Centre instead of the library and a link to the server provided for the library  That way a 24 7 power supply and service is assured   This will also make it easier for the NOC staff to manage the server when there is a problem since they will not need to trek to the library in such a circumstance  But in all situations the access control of the server should be under the Library and this should be captured in the policy  10  Statement on the standard format that all theses dissertations should meet  This should include such things as form i e  digital  pdf  arrangement of parts etc  Theses dissertations should have abstracts and keywords provided by the author of the work and approved by the supervisor before submission  11  Statement that students should submit their final and corrected theses to the library and be cleared by the library before they are graduated   This will prevent the case where students submit works that have not been corrected  CDs with improperly arranged works  those that cannot be accessed  CDs with musical works  and outright blank CDs as their finished work   Any institution therefore that seeks the support of CARLIGH  INASP or any supporting institution should be required to provide an approved and signed policy statement showing the commitment of the institution to the repository platform  Institutions that provide support must make sure that the policies are clear in their objectives and should make inquiries input to help fine tune policies before committing resources  Furthermore  no institution should accept to run the repository on a second hand server that the NOC might offer pending the purchase of a new one  An old server is prone to crash and all the work done will be lost  Once the authorities commit to the repository the library should make request for a new server before the installation of the platform is done  Needless waste of time will be prevented as the experience from the two universities showed   Then again a desk should be set up at the library purposely to check the submitted works and make sure the soft copies meet the standards outlined in the policy  The soft copies should then be labelled and properly shelved as an extra back up after the contents are uploaded onto the repository platform  The libraries should then provide clearance for the students to graduate  This will instill some discipline in the students to make them submit the right documents to the libraries  The libraries should continue to do advocacy and promote their repositories  Promotions should be done both formally and informally  Students should be introduced to the platform during their user orientation programs  Students preparing to write their theses dissertations should be reintroduced to the platform and the standard format of presentation restated to them  Information about the IR should be presented in the library s user manual if such a document exists  Posters and flyers should be designed and used to support the promotion of the platform  Half day workshops could also be set up to introduce the faculty and other staff   The misconception that all computer science graduates will be able to support or run a repository should be debunked  IT is a wide field of study and there are several branches where IT graduates specialize  One can thus have web designers  system analyst  database manager  network administrators and programmers  Therefore caution is needed when selecting   employing one to support a repository  Whoever is employed should also be able to support the other platforms of the library  If a library already has an IT support person  such a person should be given some more training in other to support the new platform  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Corletey  Institutional repositories for open access  The Ghanaian experience  CONCLUSION Institutional repositories are proving to be very good means of providing access to research findings to the communities where such research were carried out  These communities most times also happen to be the ones that need such information greatly  Academic institutions are bedrocks for undertaking research and for the Ghanaian academic institutions that graduate upwards of 10 000 postgraduates students each year  not to mention undergraduates  all of whom are required to do a research and present a report in the form of theses   dissertation  the volume of research findings that can be made available on such platforms cannot be overemphasized  But it is sad to say most of these findings are never made to have any impact as they are relegated to dusty shelves and drawers  Making such knowledge visible could promote more research into the same areas to increase knowledge  IR could also help to reduce plagiarism  When people know that their findings will be visible to the world via the internet they will be more cautious of pirating other peoples works since they could be challenged  On the other hand it will encourage quality research since findings could also be challenged for their authenticity or otherwise  The public exposure of the works will also encourage supervisors advisors of such works to be more committed to their supervisory roles since they indirectly get publicity on the internet  But most importantly it will move the institutions from being islands of information knowledge to a global community of knowledge creators managers through their interconnectedness courtesy of their repositories   CARLIGH and INASP should not relent in its efforts at seeking establishment of more of such platforms  Academic institutions which are yet to set up such platforms should be encouraged and if possible helped with policy preparation if they lack the expertise to do so  CARLIGH and INASP should also do advocacy and promote such platforms to the authorities of academic and research institutions to get them to support their libraries set up IRs  Overall the concept of IRs for all research generating institutions should continue to be of interest to all  for the country stands to be the ultimate beneficiary of such an enterprise  This view is supported by Shearer  2003  who states  If successful  IRs holds the promise of being very advantageous to researchers everywhere  especially those in the developing world   Chan  2004  adds that  research institutions and universities have the primary mission of creating  sharing  and disseminating knowledge  which are public goods  Open access through institutional repositories is a low cost and low barrier strategy for achieving this mission   It is in this vein that the institutions that CARLIGH INASP supported to set up IRs are encouraged to make this mission possible and to have their IR services up and running again  What is hoped for now all depends on the institutions of higher education and research  Their collective will and their determination to see to the free and open distribution of the intellectual works coming from their backyard is what should be the focus  All libraries within the members of CARLIGH are strongly urged to initiate proceedings in getting a policy and seeking approval to make it implementable  That first step will be the very solid move towards setting up a repository and contributing to the wealth of knowledge available to the world
