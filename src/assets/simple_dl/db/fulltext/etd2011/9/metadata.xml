Ackermann German National Library Adickesallee 1  60322 Frankfurt am Main  Germany  u ackermann dnb de ABSTRACT  Since 1998 the German National Library  DNB  has been collecting electronic dissertations and postdoctoral theses  At the beginning of 2011 the total number of collected online dissertations reached the 100 000 mark  which makes it the largest national collection of online dissertations in Europe  This success could only be achieved by close co operation with German universities  their libraries  institutional repositories and library service centres  This co operation was conducted as a string of projects funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and is known as DissOnline  a name  which has almost become its own brand  Since 2006  as a result of changes in the law regarding the German National Library  the DNB has faced a much greater task than before  To collect and archive not only all German physical media but all German online publications  Faced with this challenge  the DNB was able to utilise the experience with ETDs gained through the DissOnline project   Keywords  Required   national library  co operative project  large national collection of

 there were 600 of them in Germany  last year we reached 100 000  After a steady rise the percentage of online dissertations and post doctoral theses in all types of media is now around 40  of all dissertations   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  Figure 1  Number of online dissertation and post doctoral theses archived at the DNB  The aim of this talk is to outline how the collecting and storing of online dissertations have developed in Germany since the late 90s  During this process many difficulties had to be resolved  Firstly  users were reluctant to adopt the new technology  Secondly  there were legal issues to be resolved  Another area was the technology itself  the file formats to be used  author support  cross referencing and data protection  In addition  there was the problem of how to deal with metadata and arguably the projects greatest challenge  the long term preservation of ETDs  electronic theses and dissertations   It will be shown that this dynamic process would not have been possible without extensive cooperation among many different institutions  The German National Library is interesting in this context for many different reasons  Not only has it the largest national collection of online dissertations in Europe but there were factors unique to Germany that made this development possible  One factor is that every PhD candidate is obliged to publish his or her dissertation  Only after publication of the thesis the candidate has a legal right to use the title Dr  This is meant to guarantee access and enable readers to quote from these sources  Another factor is that the DNB has been collecting all German dissertations right from the foundation in 1912  Since then it has been its task to collect  catalogue  index  archive and make accessible all publications from within Germany and written in the German language  Initially  this was done on a voluntary basis  Later a legal deposit right was established  which means that since 1913 all German dissertations are available through the German National Library  This made it an ideal focus for installing the new digital library   THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE DISSERTATIONS IN GERMANY The founding of DissOnline  The advantages of online publications for both authors and users are obvious  the authors can publish quickly and cheaply  the users gain easy access to the latest scientific research  However  implementation was a lengthy process that required the cooperation of many stakeholders  It all began with an initiative of the learned societies  They wanted to work together to develop and use digital information and communication technologies for their members  scientific authors and readers  Diepold  2000   One branch of this project  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  dealt with dissertations online  Its main aim was to achieve easy access to research publications worldwide as well as a reduction of cost for the authors  This initiative led to a proposal to the German Research Foundation  DFG   Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  to fund an interdisciplinary project to present dissertations online on the internet  involving five German universities  Berlin  Duisburg  Erlangen  Karlsruhe and Oldenburg  and five academic fields  i e  chemistry  education  information technology  mathematics and physics  Diepold 2000   The electronic publishing of dissertations was made possible in 1997 when the KMK  The Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lander in the Federal Republic of Germany allowed the possibility of electronic publishing in their Principles of Publishing of Dissertations  Soon more partners for this project were found  university libraries  IT centres and eventually the German National Library  With its pre established task of collecting all printed German dissertations and theses it was ideally placed to start collecting online dissertations as soon as 1998  During the first few years  the submission of online dissertations was entirely voluntary  The German Research Foundation  DFG  supported and funded a string of projects on the topic of ETDs  which is now known as DissOnline  a name that has almost become its own brand   Problems and their solutions  The topic of electronic publishing led to a widespread discussion among authors  PhD candidates  universities  academics  publishers  libraries and IT centres  There were many legal and technical issues that needed to be resolved  methods of submission had to be developed and questions regarding standards and security for both file formats and metadata required an answer  Acceptance  Initially there was great scepticism towards the introduction of electronic publishing in academic circles  Fortunately  the good work done by the learned societies and the cooperation among different universities helped to overcome the general reluctance to adopt the new technology  Statistics show  however  that authors in the humanities are much less prepared to publish online than those in sciences  STM   Science  Technology and Medicine   Particularly conservative in their attitude are members of the legal profession as well as those working in the fields of business studies and economics  In these disciplines it seems that the printed word is still indispensable for the foundation of a professional reputation  Wollschlager  2003   Proceedings of the

Percentage of dissertation and post doctoral theses in the collection of the DNB which are online resources by date of publication  Creating a legal frame work  One of the most pressing tasks at the beginning was the creation of a legal framework for online dissertations  The two main issues were standardization and copy right  In Germany  it is the universities or even the faculties that are responsible for the regulations regarding dissertations  These rules had to be adapted and approved by all the relevant institutions  Some regulations were adopted by all universities  but when asked in 2003  almost a third of German universities said that it was still their faculties that were responsible for online dissertations   Wollschlager  2003  The DissOnline projects were trying to achieve a standardization of dissertation rules across all universities and their legal implementation  The question of copy right was also discussed  The stakeholders developed recommendations for contracts between author and publisher  which keep the option of an online publication on the university server open  For the universities they drew up consent forms in which the copy right of authors and libraries or IT centres was clarified and secured  Technical issues  DissOnline profited much from the cooperation with DINI  the German Initiative for Network Information  DINI is committed to improve the information and communication services in higher education institutions and learned societies  and to provide the necessary information infrastructures regionally and nationally  Its members are service institutions for the world of academia  like libraries  IT centres  media centres  as well as different associations  academic institutions and organisations  More importantly  with its DINI Certificate for Document and Publication Services the DINI sets a clearly defined standard in this field  information about the Certificate under http   www dini de dini zertifikat english    The findings of this cooperative commitment and the resulting recommendations are published on a website  www dissonline de   In addition  regular workshops provided an opportunity to present and discuss new developments  Both website and workshops run under the brand name DissOnline  Formats  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  Much discussed were the formats in which dissertations should be submitted for publication  Initially  Word or PostScript was used  then XML was the preferred option for a while  This  however  turned out to be labour intensive  For a few years now  PDF  being both proprietary but disclosed has become the established format for publication  DissOnline Tutor Another important topic for DissOnline was the support of the authors and provision of a forum where their questions could be answered  Thus DissOnline Tutor was developed in a special project  DissOnline Tutor provides authors of online dissertations and theses with word processing tools  such as Microsoft Word  Open  and StarOffice  and the document mark up language and document preparation system LaTex  In addition  authors can access interactive learning and teaching modules as well as materials  The aim was mainly to improve the technical quality of online university publications which are supposed to be archived for long term preservation  DissOnline Portal Eventually  the DissOnline Portal was developed  This portal makes the collected German dissertations centrally accessible for users  Apart from searching metadata  a full text search option is also available  Global Access To improve global access to European research theses  the DNB passes on the metadata of the ETDs from its collection to DART  the European E theses Portal  The DNB participates in this partnership of research libraries and library consortia that are working together to achieve this aim  Compound Objects One problem that is still largely unsolved is the topic of compound objects  These are ETDs that are combined with research data or multimedia or dynamic elements  So far  the opportunities for using these have not been used to the full  Today  only a few years after their appearance  Compound Objects present an often insurmountable challenge to the provider as far as immediate access and long term preservation is concerned   FROM COLLECTING ONLINE DISSERTATIONS TO COLLECTING ALL ONLINE PUBLICATIONS AT THE DNB  Since 2006  as a result of changes in the law regarding the German National Library  available only in German http   bundesrecht juris de dnbg index html   the DNB has faced a much greater task than before  To collect  record  archive and make accessible not only all publications traditionally printed from within Germany and written in the German language but all resources in a non physical format  that is all German online publications  Faced with this formidable challenge  the DNB was able to utilise the extensive experiences gained through the Dissonline projects  Transfer of Online Publications to the DNB  Since the early days different methods of submission have been tried  Email  Submission via email was used for a while but as it made a fully automated process impossible  it was abandoned last year  Web forms  Some of the first ETDs were also submitted using a web form which has been improved several times since  Experience showed that the web form should be kept as simple as possible  That way the chance of receiving correct metadata was higher even if it meant fewer information was sent  Another advantage of its simplified format is that since the extension of the deposit law in 2006 the form is mainly used by self publishers and small publishers who might not have the necessary knowhow for dealing with bibliographic metadata  This makes a short  easy to use way of submitting the metadata and the object absolutely necessary  This problem does not arise so much in university publications where the trained personnel of the university libraries fill in the fields of the forms  The new web forms permit a simple transmission of further online publications  the form for monographs can be used for ebooks  online dissertations and music  However  there are very few common mandatory fields  e g  title  publication date  address of the publication   and depending on the type of publication  further fields may be added  e g  information about the dissertation in the case of online dissertations or specific identifiers such as ISMN for music   Another form allows the  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  transmission of titles of electronic periodicals and a third the transmission of periodicals itself  The forms are connected  since a title is only registered once  when the submitter signs in the next time  he she obtains a list of his her periodicals  and by clicking  most fields for the submission of a periodical are automatically filled out  Gompel and Svensson 2011  Initially  the submission of the web form was followed by a semi manual treatment when metadata were transferred to the catalogue system using a small tool and during this process were checked intellectually  Now the metadata and resources are transferred in a fully automated manner but without any intellectual checks  The web forms are ideal for smaller quantities of publications since the submission of the metadata takes place manually  Additionally  there is a maximum allowance of 50 MB for the upload of individual pieces and of 500 MB for submission via URL   Gompel and Svensson 2011  OAI PMH  Since 2005 another method of ingest has been in use  the OAI PMH method  This is an HTTP based harvesting protocol developed by the Open Archive Initiative  This interface is very popular with universities and is used by the DNB not only to harvest metadata but also to store them its repository  During this process  a so called transfer URL  which is a mandatory metadata tag  is used to save the object onto the repository of the DNB  Similar to the web form  manual interference was initially necessary in order to transfer the metadata into the library system and to download the object via the transfer URL  Nowadays this process is also fully automated  Metadata are harvested up from the server of the depositor and transferred to the catalogue  In a second step  the object is located through the transfer URL and stored in the repository  This process runs automatically on both sides and is suitable for larger numbers of files  For commercial publishers it is  of course  especially important that the transfer URL  through which the object can be accessed directly and at no cost  does not fall into the wrong hands  The DNB therefore guarantees that this link is used exclusively for the transfer of the object and is not passed on to unauthorised persons  Overall  the OAI PMH is still unpopular as a method for submissions of publications in the commercial sector on a large scale  People still associate it with Open Access and are concerned about security  These concerns could not be dissipated even by technical facts  For that reason  the following ingest workflow was developed  especially with producers of e books and e journals in mind  Deposit via Hotfolder  An additional interface has been in operation since April 2011  Hotfolders are suitable for the transfer of larger amounts of files which are sent by a depositor to this monitored folder  The folder is called  hot  because each step of the process that takes place is monitored by another process  After registration for an account by depositors  the publications are held in a zipContainer along with the metadata  Via an automated procedure  the metadata is integrated in the catalogue and the objects are archived in the repository  The Hotfolder requires the depositor to actively provide the publications and the data  however  the interface was requested by publishers because of their familiarity with its data transfer options  such as FTP   In all three active procedures  metadata are supplied by the creator or the publisher and are transferred to the catalogue without intellectual intervention  As soon as the resource is transferred to the repository and archived  the title can be seen in the catalogue and the publication can be read in the reading room  All newly submitted online publications are recorded in the German National Bibliography  in an extra series known as the O series   Gompel and Svensson  2011  URNs as Persistent Identifiers  One of the greatest challenges in the context of digital media is their long term preservation  Naturally this question was discussed at DissOnline  Especially in the world of research it is of greatest importance that published works are easily found and quoted from  A link that ends on page 404  HTTP code not found  undermines the reliability of an academic paper  To eliminate this danger  it was decided to use persistent identifiers  These are unchanging  reliable markers that stay connected with the objects even if they are saved in different or changing locations or even in different or changing formats and systems  The task of the persistent identifier is to ensure long term access to the object  There are different systems of persistent identification  for example Handle  DOI or PURL  Within the framework of the CENL  the Conference of Europeans National Librarians  some European national libraries chose URN  Uniform Resource Name  as their persistent identifier system  This has its own namespace with the IETF  Internet Engineering Task Force   in order to enable cataloguing of digital publications in bibliographic resources and registration  RFC 3188  using National Bibliography Numbers as URNs   Therefore in 2001 the DNB started to build an infrastructure of an URN Service consisting of resolver  database and transfer surfaces   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  So how does an URN work  In a database the URN as an identifier is matched with at least one address or reference called URL  Through the URN an address of the object can be reached using a resolver  The URN has a hierarchical structure  Every URN is marked by the name urn and consists of a prefix and a suffix  The prefix contains the NID  Namespace Identifier   in our case  nbn  for National Bibliography Numbers  and the SNID  Subnamespace Identifier   By dividing the URN into subnamespaces the internationally used hierarchical structure can be continued on a national level  A central element of this is the country code  An URN that starts with urn nbn de shows that it is a German publication that can be opened using the URN resolver at the DNB  Beyond the country code the URN structure can be further defined  This opens the possibility to give institutions their own subnamespace within which they can independently give out URNs for their own publications  Giving the partners in DissOnline  usually university libraries  their own subnamespace meant that the successful cooperation could continue in the area of Persistent Identifiers  Now the university libraries give out an URN for every online dissertation that is published by them  These URNs are registered with the URN service of the DNB  After the submission of the object itself the DNB archive link in the URN database is added  in addition to the address on the original server  This concept  tested on ETDs  was extended by the DNB to other online publications  All online publications archived in the DNB get an URN from the namespace urn nbn de  The depositors can give out URNs themselves using their own subnamespace  If that does not happen  an URN is given to every publication within the ingest workflow  so each digital object that is collected and archived by the DNB possesses an URN as a persistent identifier  The resolver of the German National Library does not only hold persistent identifiers for digital legal deposit  Any issuer of digital content can depose persistent links to objects  In July 2011  over 400 institutions were using this feature and had registered over 5 million URNs  Counting approximately 3 500 queries a day  the access numbers are still relatively moderate  and with increasing use of persistent identifiers  these numbers are bound to grow  Metadata  Even in the early days of ETDs metadata were a key issue  DissOnline projects developed their own metadata format for online dissertations and theses  The first format MetaDiss was still embedded into the html basis  To enable transfer via OAIPMH this was changed to the XML based XMetaDiss in 2005  Like its predecessor MetaDiss  XMetaDiss is a sophisticated format that has about 50 elements and enables the DNB to store detailed information  for example about the people involved in a dissertation and their involvement in universities  Over the years it has been shown  however  that the possibilities of this metadata format are very rarely used to full capacity  The DNB has learned from this experience  For the submission of online publications a very simple core set of fields for metadata was developed  Especially when the web form is used  metadata are limited to this core set  XMetaDiss also contains a section for technical metadata but these are not used any more by the DNB for legal deposits  Instead it was easier to obtain this information during the automated process  So technical metadata that are needed for long term preservation are gathered during routine transactions  Last year the XML based metadata format was   again by close co operation with our partners   extended to XMetaDissPlus  2010   Now it is no longer limited to dissertations and postdoctoral theses but also includes a great variety of publications found in university depositories  for example books  articles  journals  different theses  pictures etc  It was down to the close connection and cooperation with the DissOnline partners  the German university libraries and IT centres  that the transfer of objects with metadata already attached has been realised in such a comfortable  now even fully automated manner  How close this connection is can be demonstrated by the fact that XMetaDiss was already an integral part of the repository software OPUS  which is the most popular in Germany  One could even say that the world of repositories in Germany was transformed by the developments coming out of DissOnline  The group of OPUS repositories also initiated the opening up of the format for all types of academic papers  In order to expand this development  the cooperation with DINI was sought  A focus group of DINI  the AG Elektronisches Publizieren der DINI e V   developed a Common Vocabulary of Types of Publications and Documents 2010   On the basis of that  the reference descriptions and examples for XMetaDissPlus were developed in close cooperation between the BSZ  library service centre Baden Wuerttemberg  and the DNB  In the DNB the introduction of XMetaDissPlus is closely linked to the completely automatized ingest of university theses  The new interface  now using XMetaDissPlus  can transfer metadata as well as objects into the catalogues or the repository   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Ackermann  Collecting electronic theses at the German National Library  XMetaDissPlus is downward compatible with XMetaDiss  which means that it is down to the universities whether they limit themselves to ETDs or pass on further university publications to the DNB  Beyond XMetaDissPlus there are other metadata schemes which could be used to ingest dissertations and other online resources like e books  Right now the DNB accepts also ONIX 2 1 and MARCXML metadata  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK  Academic publishing in online form is firmly established in Germany today  The close  long lasting link between the stakeholders through DissOnline  now especially through DINI and the Open Access movement  which is very active in Germany  facilitates innovations and their general implementation  DissOnline did make important contributions and pave the way for new developments  In 2006  the law demanded a new perspective from the DNB  and it rose to the challenge  Looking at the sheer volume of publications  electronic publishing and its possibility of automated processes is here to stay  and much more work is to be done  The DNB continues to strive for the same success and highest standards in the collection of all its online publications that it has already achieved with online dissertations   REFERENCES  1   Diepold  P  2000  Dissertationen Online   The ETD Project of the German Learned Societies  in Liber
