universities and academic research institutions in India were under utilized as the access to theses  dissertations and research reports were very limited to the next generation researchers and scholars  Modern information and communication technology  ICT  acts as an effective intervener for paradigm shifting from closed access theses and dissertations to open access electronic theses and dissertations  ETD   The present study brings out the ETD initiatives undertaken in India  These initiatives are presented under national and institutional level  6 national and 17 institutional ETD repositories are studied in the paper  It also discusses National Policy framework in India for building ETD repositories  UGC Regulations 2005 and 2009  INDEST Consortium  ICSSR   NASSDOC and National Knowledge Commission have provided guidelines to improve the quality of research and also to provide world wide access to research under open access  The paper aims to take an overview of the contents of these repositories and to highlight the problems in self archiving approach of researchers in India  Keywords  Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETD   India  Open Access  INTRODUCTION  India is a major South Asian country  where an array of specialized research institutions  research centres and universities situated in almost all major subject areas  Theses and dissertations are known to be the rich and unique source of information  often the only source for research work that does not find its way into various publication channels  Doctoral dissertations are manifestation of result of four to five years of intense work involving huge investment of resources  both mental and physical and infrastructure and other support from the universities  The theses collection in most of the Indian libraries  are kept in closed access  making it difficult for other students to access them  It remains an un tapped and under utilized asset  leading to unnecessary duplication and repetition that  in effect  is the antitheses of research and wastage of huge resources  both human and financial  The digital libraries of electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  are promising to be extremely advantageous to scholars especially in developing countries  The ETD initiatives started in India during late nineties and popularity of this concept is growing rapidly in the higher educational and research institutions to disseminate newly emerged knowledge and expertise  REVIEW OF LITERATURE Defining ETD  ETDs are dissertations and theses prepared for submission as text based Adobe PDF  Portable Document Format  files  ETDs can contain non text elements that cannot be incorporated into traditional hard copy theses and dissertations  Multimedia  sound  video  and hypertext links can be included to expand and deepen the expression of ideas and the presentation of research  Importantly  ETDs give broader exposure to graduate student research  It also promotes better research because of better exchange   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Hirwade  Digitization of Theses and Dissertations  Status Quo India  Merits of ETDs  Bandra  2002  identifies the merits of ETDs               To empower students to convey a richer message through the use of multimedia and hypermedia technologies  To improve graduate education by allowing students to produce electronic documents  use digital libraries and understand issues in publishing  To increase the availability of student research for scholars and preserve it electronically  To lower the cost of submitting and handling theses and dissertations  To empower universities to unlock their information resources  and To advance digital library technology   Need for developing ETD Repositories  Doctoral theses and dissertations are primary source of documents which contain lot of new ideas  innovations and new results in highly specific topic  They give insight into the developments trends in selected specific areas and also come up with solutions to the identified problem  They also put forth the prior art on a specific topic  These are useful documents for further research and must be made accessible to everyone irrespective of their physical location  In India  the access policy to the theses collection varies from university to university  In most of the universities the access is limited  Recognising the need for increasing the accessibility of theses documents  the Government of India and other agencies of national importance have framed distinctive policies and strategies to develop bibliographical and full text ETD databases  Indian national agencies like University Grants Commission  UGC   Indian Council of Agricultural Research  ICAR   Council of Scientific and Industrial Research  CSIR   ICSSR  Indian Council of Social Science Research  are initiating several steps to promote the ETD culture by providing  policy guidelines  required infrastructure and imparting training to people involved  Organizations like INFLIBNET and others have already created sizeable online database containing metadata and are accessible to every one  Major projects like Vidyanidhi have demonstrated the need and feasibility of creating ETD databases at the national level  Some of the leading universities and institutions have already taken a plunge and started creating ETD collection  Quite a few subject discipline based self archives have sprung up during the last few years who also cover ETDs  The ETD momentum is fast catching up and one can now see increasing visibility for the Indian academic research   Kumbar T S   2009  NATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK IN INDIA  University Grants Commission  INDEST Consortium   An Open Access Advocacy Group  ICSSR and National Knowledge Commission have played a vital role in framing national policies for digitization of theses and dissertations in India  UGC Regulations 2005  In 2005  the University Grants Commission of India  UGC  drafted a national policy framework entitled  UGC  Submission of Metadata and Full text of Doctoral Theses in Electronic Format  Regulations  2005   UGC s Regulatory Framework aims at evolving a mechanism to improve the quality  accessibility and availability of Indian theses and to implement uniform standards for creating metadata of doctoral theses and a system for collecting and collating this standardized data   UGC Regulation  2005  Regulation proposed two sets of planned actions  such as    Creation of Indian National Theses Database  INTED   Proposed Indian National Theses Database  INTED  is an online centralized bibliographic database  where online submission of metadata sets of a PhD thesis is made mandatory when the researcher finally submits his her PhD thesis to the Research Cell of a university  The PhD supervisor verifies and validates the metadata of submitting PhD thesis  The INTED will be freely accessible worldwide and will have simple and advanced search interfaces  Hence  bibliographic control of all recent PhD theses is assured  Although this online database will be accessible free of charge  its CD ROM version will be made available at a price     Submission of PhD Theses in Electronic Form  The researcher will submit his her PhD thesis in an appropriate electronic format  along side hard copies of his  her thesis  The UGC Regulations also suggest a specific content structure of electronic thesis  which is derived from the best practices of international ETD sites  The submitted electronic copy of the doctoral thesis will be stored in the respected University s ETD  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Hirwade  Digitization of Theses and Dissertations  Status Quo India  repository or institutional repository  The ETD repository or institutional repository should be OAI PMH compliant  so that metadata harvesting services can collect metadata of each submitted  awarded doctoral thesis  The administrator of the ETD repository will also check the quality of metadata information  The university will set up committees to formulate copyright and IPR policies  access policy  plagiarism monitoring policy  and other norms related to ETD repository  The access to ETD database can be allowed any of the following  worldwide open access  campus only access  temporary restricted access  and mixed access  partially open   The ETD may contain textual data along with images  audio objects  video objects  animation objects  spatial objects and other kind of multimedia objects  The ETD can be navigated non linearly  Thus  hard copy of a thesis document has less number of functionalities than electronic copy of a thesis  The proposed ETD repositories in universities will be developed using latest versions of IR software and will adopt latest versions of metadata schema to handle the advanced features of ETD  UGC Regulations 2009  In 2009  UGC has given one more regulation in context to  Minimum Standards and Procedure for awards of M  Phil   Ph D   Under Clause 19  the regulation provides guidelines for creation for Depository with UGC  The Clause 19 is reproduced as it is below   19  Following the successful completion of the evaluation process and announcement of the award of M Phil Ph D   the university shall submit a soft copy of the M Phil   Ph D  thesis to the UGC within a period of thirty days  for hosting the same in INFLIBNET  accessible to all institutions   universities   Implications of UGC Regulations  UGC Regulations 2005  though Regulations formulates a roadmap in achieving wide dissemination of results of doctoral research conducted in Indian universities and bibliographic control of theses and dissertations of research degrees  the universities and the researcher were reluctant to change their status quo  This may be due to the fear of plagiarism as well as the fear that the contents will be observed by pioneers worldwide  UGC Regulations 2009 has made it mandatory to deposit soft copy of thesis to INFLIBNET and set the minimum standards for the award of research degrees ultimately motivated to produce quality doctoral theses and maintain certain international standards  Online availability of electronic theses through centrally maintained digital repositories  will not only ensure easy access and archiving of Indian doctoral theses but will also help in raising the standard and quality of research  This would overcome serious problem of duplication of research and poor quality resulting from the  poor visibility  and the  unseen  factor in research output  As per the Regulation  the responsibility of hosting  maintaining and making the digital repository of Indian Electronic Theses and Dissertation  Shodhganga  accessible to all institutions and universities is assigned to the INFLIBNET Centre  INDEST Consortium   An Open Access Advocacy Group  The Indian National Digital Library in Engineering Sciences and Technology  INDEST  Consortium is an innovative initiative supported by the Ministry of Human Resource Development  MHRD  and All India Council for Technical Education  AICTE   Indian Institute of Technology Delhi  IITD  is the coordinating agency for this consortium  In 2003  INDEST core members proposed to establish an  INDEST Digital Theses Archive   Six recommendations of Recommendations of INDEST Working Group on  ETD and EPrint Archives  as reported in the document   Minutes of the Meeting held on 7th October  2003 at IIT Delhi are reproduced below   INDEST Working Group  2003       All IITs  Indian Institute if Technology  and IISc  Indian Institute of Science  should implement electronic submission of theses and dissertations in addition to their current practice of submissions in theses and dissertations in print  Following the model set up by the IISc Bangalore  all IITs may set up e print archives using OAI complaint e print software  While pre prints and re prints may be submitted at e print servers set up at various IITs   IISc  a central server may be deployed to harvest the metadata from all such e print archives  The use of OIA complaint e print software would facilitate such an environment  It was strongly felt that if the pre print   re print submission is followed strictly at all IITs   IISc  the unified collection developed in the process at IITs and IISc  as well as at other such repositories  would offer a strong alternative to existing model of scholarly publishing   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Hirwade          Digitization of Theses and Dissertations  Status Quo India  All INDEST Consortium members  i e  IITs and IISc  should follow common protocols and procedures to ensure interoperability of digital collections built up in the process of e submissions of theses  dissertations and preprints  The IITs and IISc may adopt OAI complaint software available in public domain  such as e prints archive  D space or the Virginia Tech  ETD  to ensure interoperability  4  The ETD may be planned as distributed archives with individual institutions holding their theses and dissertations on their own servers while the metadata may be harvested either online or offline on a single server  IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur  the two institutions who have already implemented ETD at their respective institutions  may provide trial access to their ETDs to other IITs   IISc  A core development group may be formed to give the technical specifications for the ETD as well as for preprints and for the development of the archive site  This group will also prepare a template for the ETD and preprint site  which can be used by any of the INDEST members to host their ETD archive  The Group may also finalize standards for the metadata needed for the ETD   Implications of INDEST Recommendations  48 centrally funded Government institutions constitute the core group of the Consortium that are divided into the four categories based on e resources allocated to them  These are IITs  IISc  National Institute of Technology  NITs   Indian Institute of Information Technology  IIITs   Indian Institute of Management  IIMs   etc  Some core member institutions have already established open access institutional repositories and ETD repositories in their respective institutions  Some core member institutions  such as  IISc  IITs  have started digitization of their back volumes of thesis and dissertation collections on project basis and make them available through open access or campus wide institutional ETD repositories  ETD IISc is considered as a role model of open access ETD repository in the INDEST family  The INDEST Consortium in association with IISc prepared a number of guidelines on the ETD and organized training workshops for implementations of open access repositories in member institutions  This Consortium also provides consultative supports to other Indian consortiums  research agencies and individual institutions in formulation of open access policies and implementation of ETD institutional repositories   Das  A K  et al   2007  There is no visible progress with respect to having  INDEST Digital Theses Archive  at the national level at this moment  ICSSR   NASSDOC  National Social Science Documentation Centre  NASSDOC   was established in 1969 as a Division of the ICSSR with the objective to provide library and information support services to researchers in social sciences  those working in academic institutions  autonomous research organisations  policy making  planning and research units of government departments  business and industry etc  NASSDOC also provides guidance to libraries of ICSSR Regional Centres and ICSSR supported Research Institutes  NASSDOC has a programme of acquiring copies of unpublished Ph D  theses in social sciences accepted by Indian universities  Since 2003 NASSDOC has revised its thesis acquisition policy  It has been decided to pay Rs 1500   to a scholar for a copy of Ph D  thesis  A scholar is required to submit a soft version  preferably CD ROM  along with a hard copy  print version  of the thesis   ICSSR  2011  NASSDOC has signed a memorandum of understanding  MOU  with Vidyanidhi Digital Library Project of Mysore University to digitise the Ph D  Theses collection of NASSDOC for wider dissemination to scholars  More than 2000 Ph D  Theses have been digitised and put on CD   ROM format  The ultimate objective is to put them on the web  so that research scholars can view them on the website  Vidyanidhi Digital Library  University of Mysore Indian ETD Collection   http   dspace vidyanidhi org in 8080 dspace  Recommendations of National Knowledge Commission  The National Knowledge Commission of India  NKC   constituted on 13th June 2005  is a high level advisory body to the Prime Minister of India  with a mandate to guide policy and direct reforms  NKC  s overarching aim is to transform India into a vibrant knowledge based society  In its first annual report entitled  Report to the Nation 2006   NKC published its first set of recommendations to the PM of India  NKC  2006   If implemented  these recommendations will have far reaching implications in the knowledge creation and dissemination cycle  NKC strongly advocates open access to public funded research literature  The theses and dissertations produced by state sponsored researchers would then make accessible through  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Hirwade  Digitization of Theses and Dissertations  Status Quo India  open access channels  such as  ETD repositories or institutional repositories  NKC also recommends expansion of Indian higher education system through establishment of new universities  including 50 national universities  totaling about 1500 universities across the country  which is about 3 times addition to existing system  This expansion would enable India to attain a gross enrolment ratio of higher education at least 15 per cent by 2015  This kind of phenomenon expansion requires a huge pool of qualified teaching and research staff  equipped with research degrees  to maintain a minimum standard of teaching and research  Similarly  present university system should also take proper measures to attract meritorious research students for future requirements and disseminate their research papers  theses and dissertations by establishing ETD institutional repositories  More recently in November  2008  the National Knowledge Commission has in its report on  More Quality Ph Ds  has recommended to the Prime Minister of India that   Ph D thesis should be uploaded on the Internet  preferably on the proposed National Research Portal  In any event  open and free access to research output in archives and other digital media resources should be made mandatory   Also the same Commission in its report  Libraries  A road map for revitalization  strongly recommended that   libraries should offer new services by creating  institutional repositories of research articles  reports  institutional publications and Electronic Theses and Dissertations   ETD   and to support these services the Commission further recommends that   all academic institutions must set up institutional repositories of ETD  This should be made mandatory for accreditation  Such repositories should offer open access   National Knowledge Commission   With this kind of initiatives and policy directions from the national bodies  ETD work in India will gain a momentum and facilitate wider access to Indian research   NKC  2008  METHODOLOGY  This preliminary study concentrates on the state of the art ETD digital libraries in India  The research method used in this study is the triangulation of three different methods        e mail questionnaire telephonic conversation and content analysis of ETD websites   ANALYSIS ETD Initiatives in India  The Indian libraries have witnessed a great impact of Information and Communication Technology  ICT  in last three decades  The development can be traced in three phases viz         First Phase  1980s  Automation of House keeping operations Second Phase  1990s  Networking of Libraries Third Phase  2001 onwards  Digitization initiatives  E content creation  Digital Repositories and Library 2 0  DOAR and ROAR  There are 47 digital repository initiatives from India have been reported in Directory of Open Access Repositories  DOAR  and 59 Indian initiatives have been reported in Registry of Open Access Repositories  ROAR    As on 17th May 2011   OpenDOAR and ROAR  2011  The ETD initiatives in India can be broadly grouped into two categories       ETD initiatives at National Level ETD initiatives at Institutional Level  Proceedings of the 14th

Building of IR It is observed from the responses that the biggest issue in developing ETD repository is Copyright  All the 17 ETD repositories have cited it as a major issue  It is followed by  unwillingness of the researchers  to deposit their thesis  88 24    The researchers have a fear that online access to their full text theses increases the chances of misuse of documents  Problem of long term preservation is the third important barrier quoted by 82 35  repositories  Difficulty of content recruitment  Lack of institutional policy  Funding problem  Lack of skilled Human Resource  Lack of necessary infrastructure  Lack of interest shown by authorities  Lack of coordination of a national body for IR  Software Problem and Integration of repository into workflow and existing structure are some of the issues in building ETD repositories  CONCLUSION The greatest advantages of ETDs are avoiding duplication in research work  ensuring quick retrieval of information  promoting resource sharing  and providing a permanent solution to the problem of space  There is no system of theses and dissertations legal deposit in India and universities  institutions are not under the subjection of the archiving organizations  so the collecting work is not very smooth and some theses and dissertations are simply lost or accumulate dust  There is need for concerted effort by all ETD
