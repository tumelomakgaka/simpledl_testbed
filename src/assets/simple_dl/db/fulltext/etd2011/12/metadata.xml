in Kenya  ABSTRACT  The study was carried out at the Kenya Library Information Services Consortium  KLISC  member institutions  The main purpose was to examine and assess the development of institutional repositories  IR  in KLISC member institutions  The objectives of the study were to examine the extent to which IR is put into actual practice  evaluate role of KLISC in supporting IR and determine barriers and intervention measures to address the problems  The paper provides useful case study to other consortia who would like to take initiative towards assisting their members to implement repositories   The study was carried through survey design and the sample constituted 35 respondents from the 75 KLISC members  Data was analyzed using statistical method and presented using tables  and graphs   The findings show that despite the challenges  KLISC members are committed to IR development and to succeed in this noble project they require considerable support from KLISC  institutional management  and external organizations   Key Words  Open Access  Institutional repositories  Digital Repository  Consortia  Kenya   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on

technological innovations over the past few years  the library began to move from being the custodian of books to an intermediary of information resources  The shift has resulted into more innovations such as the Open Access  OA  initiatives  OA involves making resources freely available globally  Berlin Declaration on Open Access to knowledge  2003  states that authors should allow all users the  free  irrevocable  worldwide  right of access to information   The United Nation recognized the importance of this right and in 1946  the General Assembly in Resolution 59  1  resolved that  freedom of Information is a fundamental human right   an implication that people have a right to access information   The momentum to embrace OA Initiative in Africa has been building up since the OA movement gained momentum as a worldwide effort to provide free online access to scholarly research  Several institutions have already established Institutional Repositories  IR   According to the World Repository Map  there are approximately 2 075 repositories internationally listed on the Registry of Open Access Repository  Of the 34 African Repositories listed  25  62   are found in South Africa  and only 4  12   are found in Kenya  1 1  IR Concept in Kenya  The concept of OA is still new in most developing countries  and Kenya indeed has embarked in this noble project  Under the Kenya Constitution 2010  the right to Information is enshrined in the Bill of Rights Article 35 where it imposes a duty on the State to publish and publicize any important information affecting the nation  Kenya Legal fraternity has begun an initiative known as Open Access to Public Legal Information to provide access to legal information  Several institutions have established or are in the initial stage of establishing Institutional Repositories  Strathmore University  International Livestock Research Institute  ILRI   and Kenya Agricultural Research Institute  KARI  are already alive on the Internet  To support these initiatives  His Excellency the President Mwai Kibaki launched the Kenya Open data Website  www opengov co ke  in July 2011 under which government agencies submit information to the website as a collaborative platform for providing free and Open Access to public Information  1 2  Role of Kenya Library Information Services Consortium  The establishment of KLISC was prompted by the move from INASP to stop funding the electronic journals that was launched in 2000 by Programme for Enhancement of Research Information  PERI   hence the need for collective subscription to PERI E Resources to share costs  Currently KLISC has membership of 75 institutions  The IR concept gained momentum in KLISC member institution when two members were funded by INASP to attend OA workshop  and later a one week attachment at the University of Pretoria  after which they began rigorous training in OA and IR to sensitize KLISC member institutions  Open Access workshops and conferences have been conducted through the support of Eifl net and INASP  About 35 of 75 KLISC member institutions have participated in these workshops and conferences and about 30 of those who participated have established or are in process of establishing IR  Most institutions began in small scale hoping to expand gradually in the future  1 3  Challenges of IR  Kenya like many developing countries is still grappling with challenges in an attempt to establish and open up their repositories to the global world  Policy issues  staffing  infrastructure  promotion and sustainability are some of the challenges facing Kenya  2   Statement of the Problem  Research and academic institutions in Kenya have come together to form a consortium to support each other in resources sharing and capacity building  All the member institutions have a goal of providing quality scholarly works to their researchers  There is hence need for research output to be captured  preserved and disseminated to address development issues in Kenya  Unfortunately  this is not so  for in many institutions  research articles  conference proceedings and theses and dissertations are locked out in closed access area where only a few can access  It was realized that a product has no good to a customer if it is not readily available when and where it is wanted  There is  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Building Institutional Repositories in KLISC member Institutions in Kenya  hence need for proper ways to manage  preserve and disseminate local content to enhance resources sharing for development  This can be effective through the establishment of IRs so that users can access valuable local content remotely for scholarly enhancement and national development  The aim of the study is to assess the extent to which IR has been established to capture local content  the role of KLISC in supporting the establishment  and the challenges and intervention measures  The research seeks to evaluate the extent to which the Institutional Repository  IR  concept is put into actual practice at KLISC member institutions in Kenya  determine the role of KLISC in supporting the establishment of IR in Kenya  and establish barriers to effective establishment and development of IR in Kenya and recommend for intervention measures   METHODOLOGY 3   Research design  The study adopted case study approach that investigated the prospects of establishing IRs in Kenya to enhance access and sharing of information  Orodho  2003  describes a case study as an approach to seek to describe a unit in detail  in context and holistically  This method brought out deeper understanding of the development of repositories in Kenya and in developing countries in general  The fieldwork concentrated on KLISC member institutions  focusing on developing of IRs and the challenges involved  The study population included staff directly involved in IR initiatives  These were targeted because they are conversant with the IR concept  3 1 Sample size  The researcher used stratified sampling to come up with two strata for those who have attended KLISC trainings in OA  and those not trained  According to Frankfort Nachmias  1996  the researcher can select a percentage of the population at hand to get a sample size suitable for the study  Since the researcher s main objective was to find out the extent to which IR has been established in Kenya  judgmental and random methods were used  and 85   30 respondents  of sample trained  and 13   5 respondents  of the sample not trained were selected  Hence the total sample size added up to 35 respondents  3 2 Data Collection Procedures  The researcher used unstructured open ended questions to give respondents freedom to express their views  and structured closed ended questions  Response rate was 74   Of the 35 questionnaires sent to respondents  26 were filled and emailed back to the researcher  while 9 questionnaires were not returned  3 3 Data Analysis  Analysis of data involved preparation of mean  and percentages that were presented in the form of graphs  pie charts  and tables to tabulate data   QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  The chapter presented discusses the analysis of the questionnaires to determine the establishment of IR as per the objectives  4  Response rate  Of the 35 questionnaires distributed to respondents  26 returned completed questionnaires  an impressive response rate of 74   an indication of significant interest in developing Institutional Repositories  IR  4 1 Part A  General Information  This part was designed to cover general information about the respondents   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Building Institutional Repositories in KLISC member Institutions in Kenya  The respondents in this study were selected from various types of libraries to ensure data reliability  Of the 26 respondents  11  42 3   were from public institutions  11  42 3   from private institutions  and  4  15 4   from research libraries  a balanced representation of the KLISC members The respondents were asked to indicate their designation  Out of twenty six respondents  21  81   were senior librarians  3  12   were in the middle grades while only 2  7   were in the lower cadre of staff  Lovelock  1996  indicates that professional qualification is an important element in providing effective quality services  but as the profession develops  it is mandatory for librarians to acquire ICT skills to spearhead ICT related project such as IR projects  4 2 Part B  Extent to Which IR is put into actual Practice in Kenya  This section deals with objective one  which establishes the extent to which IR is put into actual practice in Kenya  4 2 1  IR establishment  The respondents were asked if they have established an IR in their institution  The results indicated that 17  65   institutions have embraced or are in the process of establishing IR in their institutions  while 9  35   have not established IR  Among those not established IR  they were further asked if IR is in their Library Strategic Plan  7  78   responded yes  while only 2  18   responded no  an implication that the 7  78   who have included IR in their strategic plan will definitely establish IR in future  Those who claimed to have no plan for IR establishment gave several reasons as listed below   Figure 2  Reasons for not developing IR  Source  Field data  These findings indicate that with more guidance and sensitization on the benefits of IR  most KLISC institutions will be willing to embrace the IR concept  4 3 2  Open Access Policy  OA  and IR  The respondents were asked to indicate if they have IR policies in place  Of the authorities responding  just 6  23   claimed to have a policy  while 20  77   claimed they had no policy  This is worrying that so few institutions recognize the need for formulation of IR policies to regulate good practice in the development of IR  Without a policy the project will definitely not succeed  It is encouraging that though 20  77   claimed they did not have a policy in place  a number noted that it was under development  4 3 4  The Software used for the development of IR  The respondents were asked to indicate the type of software used  and 15  57   indicted that they were using Dspace  followed closely by Greenstone with 10  38    and others with 1  5    Having conducted several workshops in Dspace and Greenstone in 2009 and 2010  it was not surprising that the two software were the most preferred  This is an indication that training is an important factor in influencing choice  4 3 5  IR Progress in KLISC Member Institutions  Respondents were asked to indicate their progress in the implementation of IR  It was found out that majority of the respondents are in the process of customization and submission and only 5  19   are on intranet and 3  10   are alive on the web  hence need for technical support to complete the installation process

in Kenya  4 3 6  Contents Collections Submitted in IR  The respondents were asked to indicate the kind of content deposited in their IR and response shows high preference for theses and dissertation as the figure indicates below  This is an indication that there is need to work on policy issues regarding theses and dissertation to allow submission and access to local content   Figure 5  Content

generally indicates that equipment such as scanners for digitization  IR sustainability and copyright are serious issue affecting the development of IR in most of the institutions  It was found out that the library management concentrates more on provision of computers more than other issues  hence affecting the development of the project  4 4  Part C  The Role of Kenya Library Information Services Consortium  KLISC  In Supporting the Establishment of IR In Kenya  Section C was designed to find out the respondents opinion on the role of KLISC in supporting member institutions to establish IR   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Building Institutional Repositories in KLISC

disagree  disagree and neither agree nor disagree  the result above reveal that there is a lot KLISC can do to support the IR project apart from the support they give for E Resources  This may involve sharing costs in purchasing relevant equipment for member Institutions  which respondents indicated 20  77   strongly disagree and disagree  There is also need to facilitate sensitization for authors and researchers for as Barton  2004  indicated  academicians have to hear about IR service many times over a period of time and from several sources before they embrace it  The overall findings of the role of KLISC in supporting IR indicate that KLISC supports development of IR but to a little extent  4 4  Part D  Section D of the questionnaire sought to find out barriers affecting the establishment of IR in KLISC member institutions and the intervention measures 4 5 1  IR Awareness by high level management  The respondents were asked to give their opinion on how much the high level management in their institution understands the importance of IR  Majority of 11  42   felt the management know little  7  27   indicted fairly well  Of the remaining  2  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Building Institutional Repositories in KLISC member Institutions in Kenya   8   declined to answer  and 6  23   indicated very well  Among those indicated very well  4  70   were from private universities and research institutions  The result generally indicates that top level management understands little about the importance of IR  4 5 2  Establishment of Committees to oversee the development of IR  The respondents were asked if management committee is in place to look into issues regarding the development of IR in their institutions  Of the respondents 13  50   indicated no  9  35   indicted yes  while 4  15   declined to answer  This finding indicates that half of the institutions do not have a committee in place  This finding is not surprising bearing in mind that various issues concerning IR have not been adequately addressed hence derailing its development  The respondents were further asked if they think IR establishment is important in their institution  26  100   responded yes  The respondents were further asked to give reasons for their answer and the range of comments which accompanied this answer suggests that respondents appreciate the need for IR despite the challenges   Reasons  Total No  of respondents  26     Pro active response to OA

consider copyright issues as the major constraint  22  85   experience difficulties in issues concerning infrastructure  Lack of prioritization of IR in library activities was also cited by 23  88   of the respondents  indicating the need to embrace IR as a core activity in the library to place proper structures to support it  Library management needs to target the top level management to ensure proper support in all areas in the implementation of IR  4 5 6  How Constraints could be addressed  The study set out to elicit solutions from the respondents as to how these barriers might be overcome  Their suggested solutions are enumerated below  Solution 1  Management Support       Proper staffing structure Considering IR as one of the core activities in the library and place proper structure to support it Include IR in the library strategic plan for budget implications  staffing and sustainability Put up committees to develop IR policies that should include high level management  legal officers  Board of postgraduate  researchers  lecturers  and postgraduate student representative Ensure research carried out within situation s funding or funding from other bodies  Solution 2  Support from KLISC          Spearheading for follow up training in IR software for KLISC member institutions Follow up visits to institutions that have developed or are in the process of developing IR to support them Provide forum discussion groups for librarians ICT specialists to share skills and discuss issues related to IR  Facilitate attachments visits in institutions that are well established in IR so as to learn from each other  Facilitate in the sensitizing of KLISC member policy makers through conference or workshops so that they can understand  appreciate and support IR initiatives within their institutions  The conference workshop should be attended strictly by head of institutions  Model sample policies which others can customize Facilitate in joint purchasing of equipment such as automatic scanner to be used by the members  SUMMARY  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  5 0  Summary and Conclusion  Conclusion of the study is based on the research questions  Establishment of IR is generally influenced by factors such as management support and KLISC support  It was found out that each institution has a responsibility to ensure the development of IR  The Library must take the responsibility to sensitize top level management to gain support  The management needs to support IR in policy formulation and sustainability   Secondly  KLISC can enhance its role in supporting member institutions to establish IR  It could be argued that at least KLISC member institutions are not dissatisfied with its performance regarding IR support but suggest for more support  On the other hand KLISC role should be to ensure that members are all on board in regards to IR  5 1 Recommendations  Lack of government framework and policy regulations to guide institutions made researchers unwilling to share research information online  For radical improvement it would be necessary to have more backing from the government  preferably to the extent of developing and Open Access policy for the country for institutions to gain government support  The government of Kenya should be at the fore  front to initiate Open Access project and to provide an enabling environment for such projects  In the short term  however  the following recommendations should be carried out by the library authorities  Institutional high level management and KLISC   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Building Institutional Repositories in KLISC member Institutions in Kenya  5 2 1  Establishment of IR in Kenya  Regarding establishment of IR  the libraries need to involve the senior level management staff to gain their support  For them to convince the top management they need to come up with a proposal and aggressively justify the importance of IR within the institution  The library should put in place modalities concerning staffing structure policy to ensure IR unit has adequate trained staff to devote time to IR related issues  The library needs to include IR in their performance contract or Library Strategic Plan to ensure budget allocation   The library should lobby for the formation of a committee that comprises the legal officer  Board of Postgraduate  Library Management and other top management to oversee the establishment of IR   It is the library s responsibility to sensitize staff  authors and researchers on the importance of IR to ensure support from all areas  Regarding promotion  apart from workshops  direct marketing can also be used to promote and sensitize researchers  authors  faculties  and users  This can be done by embracing the use of e mail  list serve  telephone and word of mouth  and use of web 2 0  Just as money is allocated for other activities  money should be allocated for promotional activities such as user awareness day  workshops for researchers  On the other hand  the institutional management must ensure proper infrastructure is in place to enhance IR development  Equipment such as scanners  adequate computers  and software must be included in the library budget  5 2 2  Role of KLISC  KLISC should take the leadership role to support their member institutions in development of the IR  The consortium should be more innovative so that they not only provide E Resources but also support their member institutions in innovative projects such as the IR project  They should get ways of responding to the challenges facing IR in Kenya  that is  infrastructure  policy issues  training  and sensitization  KLISC can mobilize resources from members  and solicit for funds from International organizations through proposals  The funds can be used for training  purchasing of equipment such as quality automatic scanners are beyond reach of many institutions  This could be done collectively and placed at a central position where any institution that needs to use it may collect from the central area   Apart from training  KLISC can go beyond to provide follow up visits to support institutions in need or to assess the impact of the training  In a situation where an institution needs support  KLISC should be in a position to facilitate attachment visits to institutions that are well established so that the members can learn from each other By taking the leadership role  KLISC can facilitate the sensitization of top government officials and member policy makers through national conferences to help them understand appreciate and support IR initiatives  5 3  Recommendation for further research  This was a survey of the establishment of Institutional repositories in Kenya  current status and emerging challenges  The researcher recommends a study that involves all institutions in Kenya irrespective of whether they are members of KLISC or not so as to get a true picture of IRs in Kenya   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town
