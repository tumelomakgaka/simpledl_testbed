processing of ETDs  but have we ever stopped to consider the postgraduate student s perspective in this process  In this paper we offer you three perspectives from three different role players in the ETD process at the University of Pretoria  namely the postgraduate student doing research  the librarian repository manager  and then lastly the author of ETDs  It is inevitable that somewhere in this knowledge production process these role players will cover common ground  and we will acknowledge that  The paper starts by explaining who the role players are  followed by the postgraduate student s perspective  Then we discuss the role of the library in establishing an open access ETD repository for graduates and students as well as the life cycle of the thesis or dissertation at this institution  Lastly we supply the graduate s perspective and a conclusion  ROLE PLAYERS IN ETDS  The role players in the ETD process are the academic community at large  funding agencies  the institution  the library  the supervisor  the student and the graduate  Copeland  Penman   Milne  2005   We distinguish between students and graduates where students are registered students busy with postgraduate research whilst graduates are the students who have completed their research theses or dissertations and placed them in an institutional repository  In this paper the second author will offer the perspectives of both these role players  Each one of these role players is important and has a unique position in the process   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Olivier   Louw  The dot on the i  ETDs   UP  POSTGRADUATE STUDENT S PERSPECTIVE  Most postgraduate students will agree that there are stages in his her study when progress is slower than expected and when motivation runs low  Very often these stadia happen during the writing up of the literature review  The absolute wealth of knowledge that exists is sometimes more of a burden than a blessing  but a few good theses or dissertations in you field can make a world of difference  The moment you see what other people have done with the similar literature that you are engaging with  your own creative processes kick in  At least this is applicable to me   I was fortunate to have a very experienced and thorough supervisor  Prof Kobus Maree  for my Masters degree  He introduced me to theses and dissertations as sources of condensed information  He allowed me to construct my first draft and then he directed me to appropriate and related theses to read and get inspiration from  It didn t matter whether I was busy with the problem statement or data analysis  he knew where to send me to get ideas on how to improve my own work  I soon realised that these theses and dissertations also supply an extensive list of references and that these references are valuable future sources   Discovering Electronic Resources  When I started my postgraduate studies in the early 2000 s  after a break of 20 years  I had to be trained to use electronic resources  do literature searches and even how to use Google  I was comfortable to go to the library to take out books  I was used to studying them at home and making notes  and often made some copies of important parts for future use  These piles of copies soon took on a life of their own  When I was introduced to UPeTD  the repository of electronic theses and dissertations at the University of Pretoria  I realised that I never needed to make copies of theses again  With an electronic repository I would have access to a wealth of knowledge whenever I needed it   Benefits of ETDs for the Student  I experienced many benefits whilst using ETDs and the following benefits were applicable in my case  ETDs provided me with     increased access to information and research that enhanced the quality of my thesis and dissertation      methods used during other research  thus allowing me to use these methods too      less paper copies that needed storage space which were also environmentally friendly  since I didn t need to make copies of parts  for in case  I needed it later        an opportunity to see exactly what has been researched in my field  and to avoid duplication of research  the opportunity to access ETDs when I needed them  and     the opportunity of learning how to work with electronic resources   Additional benefits for students and institutions are identified by Bandra  2002  as     empowering students to convey a richer message through the use of multimedia and hypermedia technologies      improving graduate education by allowing students to produce electronic documents        using digital libraries and understanding issues in publishing  increasing the availability of student research for scholars and preserving it electronically      lowering the cost of submitting and handling theses and dissertations      empowering universities to unlock their information resources  and     advancing digital library technology   I want to emphasise the fact that as a postgraduate student good quality theses were inspirational to me and empowered me to be more creative in using specific ideas and apply it in my thesis  An experienced promoter will always have suggestions for  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Olivier   Louw  The dot on the i  ETDs   UP  students  but many students have to study with young  inexperienced promoters and can benefit hugely by studying a few theses in their field of study  Students will soon be able to differentiate between good and average quality work   Involvement with UPeTD  In 2003 my dissertation  Louw  2003  had to be submitted in hard copy format with one extra copy in a box  unstapled  to be processed for microfiche purposes  This box also had to contain an electronic version of the dissertation in MSWord  My PhD thesis  Louw  2006  was also submitted in hard copy  but I had to produce the thesis in PDF format on a CD as well  At that point I didn t have a PDF conversion programme and had to e mail all the chapters to the promoter s secretary and she returned them to me in PDF format  Today I agree with Copeland and Penman  2004  who asserted that creating ETDs also improve students  IT skills   THE REPOSITORY MANAGER S PERSPECTIVE  The repository manager will share the ETD processes and workflow at the University of Pretoria and will explain the responsibilities of the Open Scholarship office  the retrospective digitization project and lastly ownership issues   UP Background  The University of Pretoria is one of the largest universities in South Africa and one of the leading research universities in South Africa and Africa  The university is spread over six campuses  has 9 faculties  one business school and offers more than 1800 academic programmes in two of the official languages  namely Afrikaans and English  According to the latest statistics from the BIRAP  Bureau for Institutional Research and Planning  office  the total student population in 2010 was 63 500 and approximately 1456 degrees were awarded in that year to postgraduate students  189 theses and 1267 dissertations    The Establishment of UPeTD  In other parts of the world the debate about the electronic implementation of theses and dissertations started as early as the mid 1990s  Copeland  Penman   Milne  2005   In 2000  Prof Ed Fox of Virginia Tech visited and demonstrated the e thesis specific ETD db software at the University of Pretoria and it was decided to utilize this software for the University of Pretoria s electronic theses and dissertation repository  named UPeTD  Hammes  2010   The University of Pretoria realised that as one of the leading research institutions in South Africa  the electronic implementation should receive priority  We agree with other authors  Suleman   Fox  2003  about ETD goals  and see the goals as     improving   enhancing graduate education      increasing the availability of student research by developing accessible digital libraries  and     preserving and disseminating ETDs electronically   In 2003 a mandatory policy for electronic theses and dissertations was adopted and implemented  This policy states that each student should submit paper and electronic copies  in both MSWord and PDF format  of his her thesis or dissertation to the Postgraduate Office of their relevant faculty  Alternatively students may self submit their theses dissertations to the UPeTD system  by making use of the training material on the UPeTD web http   upetd up ac za authors publish index htm   These paper and electronic copies are accompanied by an UPeTD submission form which is fully completed and signed by the student  the supervisor as well as the postgraduate officer of the faculty  In this form  supervisors in collaboration with their students indicate their preferences regarding access to their theses and dissertations   The University of Pretoria fully supports free access to research literature and because theses and dissertations are not formally published  we strive to provide full access to them  The following access options are available to students and researchers   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Olivier   Louw  The dot on the i  ETDs   UP     worldwide availability      limited access within the UP domain      restricted access for a period of two years   usually to allow time to complete the publication of research articles  and     total embargo to prohibit access to confidential or sensitive information   It is the responsibility of the faculty postgraduate officers to collect both the hard and electronic copies of the theses and dissertations and to deliver them to the Open Scholarship Office  The postgraduate faculty administrator places the electronic copy  on a CD  in a specially designed envelope together with the submission form and the hard and electronic copies are shipped to the library after the graduation ceremonies  The entire process is illustrated in Figure 1   Figure 1  Role players and ETD life cycle at the University of Pretoria  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Olivier   Louw  The dot on the i  ETDs   UP  Responsibilities of the Open Scholarship Office  The Open Scholarship office which is housed in the library was formally established in 2007 with only two permanent and two temporary staff members  It was decided from the start that self submissions would be encouraged  but library staff members will follow the mediated approach in submitting the items  A few students self submit their theses or dissertations  but the uptake is slow and most students prefer to follow the easier option of submitting at the faculty office  Those that make the effort to self submit are rewarded by having their items processed first   they receive preference in the workflow at the Open Scholarship Office   Upon receipt of the batch of theses and dissertations in the library  the ETD officer carefully awards a number to each item and the details of these submissions are recorded on an Excel spreadsheet mainly for statistical purposes  The theses and dissertations are separated as they are processed by two different staff members   one  full time and one a contract worker  Only the self submitted items receive preference in the workflow  the rest are processed in no specific order  The theses and dissertations are only released after the graduation ceremonies which annually take place in April and September  The Open Scholarship Administrator is responsible for the quality control process  After the release of the electronic items  the subject cataloguers receive notification of the new electronic items and the hard copies are simultaneously distributed to them  The hard copies are catalogued on the Millenium library system and a link is also provided in the library catalogue to the electronic version   Retrospective Digitization Project  Due to the fact that the submission of theses and dissertations were voluntary during the early years of UPeTD s inception  it was decided to register a retrospective digitization project  Two temporary staff members were contracted to digitize only the fronts of the ETDs completed between 2000 and 2004  From the outset  requests for complete studies were received from individual researchers in South Africa as well as many other countries all over the world via the UPeTD postbox  Our own Interlending Section soon also became one of UPeTD s clients for priority treatment  for their overseas requests  The retrospective digitization project was completed towards the end of 2010  but the current interlending requests are still digitized from the old hard copies and submitted to the UPeTD repository   Ownership of Property Rights  According to the General Regulation G57 6  of the University of Pretoria  the rights with regard to intellectual property that is produced by a student during his her studies  vest in the University   including the copyright of UP theses and dissertations  A notification to this effect is added to each ETD  In exceptional cases if students want to republish their research  they may apply to have their rights ceded back to them  Although the copyright notification will be adjusted  indicating the student as the copyright holder  the item is not withdrawn from UPeTD   Although graduates are intrinsically involved in the ETD process  little is known about the graduate s perspective regarding ETDs  The graduate was thus approached to provide retrospective feedback on the complete ETD process   GRADUATE S PERCEPTION  I can still remember the day when I received the e mail from the University of Pretoria  informing me that my thesis was released in UPeTD  I couldn t believe it and immediately accessed the link to see with my own eyes  I printed the URL information out and I still to this day have the yellowed piece of paper in my top drawer   Since I graduated  many colleagues and friends have accessed my dissertation and thesis electronically  Initially my promoter gave students my phone number and they would call me to ask for an electronic copy of my work  but lately requests come in via email  I then simply refer them the UPeTD link and then they also have access to more theses and dissertations  Recently a staff member from UNISA e mailed me because she knew I did an experimental design in my thesis and she was supervising a similar study  Again I could provide her with the link  She was in Singapore at the time   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Olivier   Louw  The dot on the i  ETDs   UP  I feel proud to have my work in UPeTD and I think that putting your work in the public domain like this  ensures a wider audience  Copeland and Penman  2004   but also continued engagement in the field  Tenopir  2003  found through research that students and academic staff members prefer electronic access to theses  since it is less time consuming and convenient   Since I became involved in postgraduate student supervision as well as review work for journals  I realised the value of ETDs once more  I do  however  warn students against the temptation of plagiarism  since it seems so easy when using electronic resources  Due to sophisticated anti plagiarism programmes used by most universities to screen ETDs  plagiarism needn t be a threat for students  The mere fact that ETDs are available in full text provides optimum access  increased visibility and therefore offers protection to a student s intellectual property and prevents plagiarism  ETD guide  2010    Access to ETDs also enhances network possibilities between individuals as well as institutions  My experience is very positive in this regard  I previously made contact with some authors of ETDs via email and without exception they all responded to my inquiry or comment  Knowledge creation and sharing has moved away from dark disorganised offices with bundles of papers to the world wide web and electronic documents   UPETD HIGHLIGHTS  In January 2010 UPeTD celebrated its first decade of success  It is undoubtedly the most successful ETD repository in South Africa and Africa and according to the January 2011 Ranking web of world repositories it is number 162 of the top 800 institutional repositories  Currently the UPeTD repository provides access to 6578 ETDs  According to webalizer statistics it has approximately 1200 visits daily   UPeTD has also been a member of NDLTD since 2005  Past achievements include four NDLTD award winners     NDLTD Innovative ETD Award 2005   Pienaar  Rousseau City building MArch  Prof  http   upetd up ac za thesis

  UPeTD will be migrated to the other University of Pretoria repository UPSpace  which makes use of the DSpace software  UPSpace is currently undergoing an upgrade process to version 1 6 2 and after its successful implementation  and with the assistance of IT expertise the migration will be implemented  Jones  Jones 2004  mentions that DSpace is seen as being ahead of ETD db and that it offers more functionality in security and administration      An integrated portal environment that will deal with the complete postgraduate student s workflow process   from registration to submission of the ETD in the repository by means of the Oracle software  This will include a shared work space for postgraduate students and supervisors  Hammes  2005    These changes will undoubtedly involve challenges to the Open Scholarship Office at the University of Pretoria  but we need  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa

postgraduate research   CONCLUSION  In this paper we highlighted the fact that the final ETD is just the dot on the i and that it entails an intricate work process for the role players  Although this paper only shared the perspectives of the postgraduate student  repository manager and the graduate student  we recognize the efforts of all other role players   The most prominent advantage of ETDs is avoiding duplication in research work  Through ETDs the quick retrieval of information is ensured and resource sharing is promoted  It is important that ETD practitioners meet regularly at congresses  symposia and workshops to facilitate the establishment of networks between different institutions in multiple countries  It is not in the interest of knowledge creation that institutions operate like islands whilst the world has became a global village and information travels across the globe in seconds  These kinds of gatherings empower repository managers to inform academics  supervisors  researchers  administrators  and policy makers of the new trends and developments in ETD processes   REFERENCES  Bandra  S  2002  Digitization of theses  Possible international
