management of electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  requires effort across the entire life cycle to ensure that ETDs are managed  preserved  and made accessible in a manner that today s users expect  Given the pressure of reading more in less time  today s users demand access to various formats regardless of temporal and spatial restrictions and the types of devices used  Digital curation is the active management of any type of digital resource through its entire life cycle  from creation and active use  to preservation and re use  ETDs are a highly specialized collection that demands a more specialized treatment and characterization to better capture the semantic relations of the underlying concepts  Over the past year  the University of North Texas  UNT  Libraries have put forth great effort in making digital collections more accessible and useful in research processes  This paper discusses UNT s ETDs curatorial activities including how ETDs users can benefit from desiccated versions  traditionally discussed only in a digital preservation context  Keywords  desiccation  long term access  preservation  ETD  INTRODUCTION  Today  more urgently than ever  researchers need ways to facilitate their research while at the same time promoting scholarly communication within and beyond their own domains  As electronic theses and dissertations continue to be an area of great interest to institutions of higher learning throughout the world  there is an increased need to improve access to these resources across a variety of access systems and tools  The University of North Texas  UNT  Libraries have re envisioned the level and type of access to the collection of Electronic Theses and Dissertations it houses as part of the UNT Digital Library  UNT has approached this process with the use of a methodology it is calling  data desiccation  as it archives and provides access to the scholarly output of students at UNT  The authors define data desiccation as the systematic migration to formats which provide a limited set of functionality when compared to the original format but which provide a simplified preservation strategy and additional access points to the underlying information  Specific examples are explained later in this paper  Overview  The University of North Texas  UNT  has a long history with electronic theses and dissertations  Since 1999  the UNT Graduate School has mandated the electronic submission of theses and dissertations as a requirement for graduation from the masters and doctoral programs at the university  Partnering with the Toulouse School of Graduate Studies  the UNT Libraries provide long term storage and preservation and provisions access to these documents to interested users around the globe  The Digital Projects Unit of the UNT Libraries began investigating ways to provide additional end user access points to these documents in the summer of 2009 and arrived at the process described in this paper  To date over 4 000 ETDs have been migrated to the new delivery format  and  as new documents are deposited  they receive automatic migration to the new data model   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Phillips   Alemneh   Data Desiccation  Facilitating ETDs Access   Preservation  WORKFLOW  Data desiccation in the context of the UNT ETDs first involves converting the deposited PDF into a series of image files that serve as the primary access point to the documents online  UNT has decided that high quality JPEG images are to be used as the image format for this conversion process  As shown in Table 1  both the TIFF and JPEG2000 file formats were investigated before this decision was made  but each format posed challenges to existing workflows or cost models and did not provide additional preservation or access features   Format  Average Image Size  Local workflows for processing  JPEG2000  5 MB  No  TIFF  64 MB  Yes  JPEG  7 MB  Yes  Table 1  File Formats Examined  UNT utilizes Adobe Acrobat Professional  Version 9 1 1  for the conversion of the PDF documents to JPEG  Each image is saved as a 24bit RGB image at 600 dpi  the highest level quality setting  least amount of compression  available in the tool is used when saving the image  All internal color spaces are converted to RGB for the export  This conversion was carried out on 4 000 files  resulting in more than 500 000 JPEG images  During the automated conversion of files many errors occurred  particularly for the older ETDs created using older versions of Adobe Acrobat software  For those items with conversion errors  UNT employed a number of methods in order to resolve all transformation issues  The most common method used was to print and rescan pages that did not automatically convert during the process  Table 2 depicts some of the common conversion issues together with the possible solutions and corrective measures   Issue Type  Error Message  Number of Instances  Remark  Pages not able to be converted   Acrobat Couldn t save a page in this document because of the following errors  Bad Parameter   164  UNT printed scanned and reprocessed pages   Non Windows and or not embedded fonts   Cannot find or create the font  Times Bold   Some characters may not display or print correctly    323   Times Bold  is not a font that is typically installed on Windows platforms  This problem seems more prevalent with LaTeX users who would not embed fonts  It is possible that this is a font that is used on Mac or Linux systems  The equivalent font for Windows is  Times New Roman   UNT has corrected the problem with a  preflight  script that handles embedded fonts   Some other set of type that may not quite affect pdf to jpg conversion   Cannot find or create the font  WPMathA   Some characters may not display or print correctly        Acrobat failed to send a DDE command      Despite these error messages  UNT was able to convert the files  There appears to be a delayed reaction and the error message still displays after the successful completion of pdf to jpg conversion  The only apparent solution to get rid of the annoying error message is to just close and reopen the file  This error does not happen consistently and seems to be more prevalent with LaTeX users   Such error messages occur when saving a file with password security in Adobe Acrobat  UNT solved that by going to Edit  Preferences  Security and unchecking  Verify signatures when the document is opened    Table 2  Files with Conversion Issues  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Phillips   Alemneh   Data Desiccation  Facilitating ETDs Access   Preservation  Once the image creation has been completed  UNT matches the image sequences to the pagination in the ETD  While somewhat tedious this process reveals a number of issues which have gone unnoticed   in many cases  for over a decade  For the recording of image sequence and pagination the UNT Libraries use a common file naming convention used throughout the digital library and digital conversion world  Locally this process is known as  magick numbering  of a document  The process involves two running sequences of numbers concatenated into a single filename  Table 3 demonstrates this technique   Sequence  Pagination  Filename  1  Title Page  000100tp jpg  2  Copyright page  00020000 jpg  3  Abstract  00030000 jpg  4  ii  000400ii jpg  5  iii  00050iii jpg  6  iv  000600iv jpg  7  1  00070001 jpg  8  2  00080002 jpg  9  3  00090003 jpg                 Table 3  Magick Numbering  For the ETD conversion an eight digit filename was used  however magick numbers can be easily extended to allow for pagination and sequences above 9 999 pages by moving to a ten digit filename  There are several methods of notating pages numbered with Roman numerals and other document features such as numbered plates  and front  back  and inside  While some of the work for this process can be done in an automated manner  it is still the most time consuming operation in the workflow  One positive side effect of this process is the ease in which mis numbered or missing pages can be identified typically a trigger event which may necessitate communication with the Graduate School and possibly an updating of the document held by the Libraries  To date 35 dissertations contained errors that required intervention by the Graduate Scholl in order to move forward with the migration  Once the magick number is completed and any errors have been resolved  the files are run through an optical character recognition  OCR  process utilizing the PrimeOCR engine  The proprietary PRO format from the PrimeOCR engine is then converted into a simple ASCII text file and a UNT specific word bounding box file  All of these derivative files  in addition to the originally deposited PDF version are combined to form the submission information package  SIP  used for ingest into the repository  alemneh daniel      01 jpg        000100tp jpg

preservation repository infrastructure  Web size derivative files are created such as thumbnail and smaller resolution images  which are presented to the end users of the UNT Digital Library  METS files are created automatically to provide structural information and providing a framework for storing preservation metadata using the PREMIS data dictionary  Tools such as JHOVE and the Unix File utility are used to provide file characteristics  which are additionally stored in the METS file for future use in preservation planning and policy development  The archival information package  AIP  is deposited in the UNT Libraries  digital archive called Coda  and the access content package  ACP  is moved into the UNT developed Aubrey content delivery system where users around the world access it through the UNT Digital Library interface  IMPROVING ACCESS  Academic libraries provide services to support the creation  organization  management and use of digital scholarship  Like so many academic libraries  the UNT Libraries are actively and continuously seeking to support research and scholarship at UNT by facilitating and enabling the creation and use of diverse scholarly contents  The UNT Libraries compile system wide aggregated usage statistics for digital resources they manage  As can be seen from Figure 1  the UNT Digital Library is used more than half a million times by people in over 200 countries around the world  In the UNT Digital Library system  ETDs receive significant usage compared to the overall percentage of digital objects  In the 2010 2011 academic year alone  UNT ETDs were accessed more than 300 000 times from around the world  It is expected that providing JPG format in addition to the original PDF format will facilitate access and further promote the scholarly output of UNT s alumni   Figure 1  UNT Digital Library Access By Countries  from September 2009 to March 2011   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Phillips   Alemneh   Data Desiccation  Facilitating ETDs Access   Preservation  Access Via Mobile Technologies The proliferation of tablets  mobile phones  connected appliances and other smart machines is driving up the demand for connectivity  Cisco predicts that the number of network connected devices will be more than 15 billion  twice the world s population  by 2015   i e  more than two connections for each person on earth   It is projected that mobile data traffic will grow 40 times over the next five years and that more people will  access the Web from their mobile devices than from their desktop computers  Cisco 2011   Before fully adopting  and investing resources in deployment of mobile technology  many institutions try to assess the trends and perform cost benefit analyses  Accordingly  UNT has started preliminary assessments and made Blackboard Mobile available for open testing by faculty and students  Results from a spring 2011 survey of UNT students using Blackboard show that 94 6  of respondents already own smartphone devices  while 2 9  plan to buy one within the next twelve months  A majority of the students also responded that they would definitely use their smartphone devices to complete specific tasks which would perhaps include accessing the digital resources of the UNT Libraries if it were possible to do so   Summary data from this spring 2011 survey are available here  http   svy mk kX8iVD    Figure 2  Access to UNT Digital Library Via Mobile Devices  from September 2009 to March 2011   As shown in Figure 2  UNT also collects data about the types of devices users employed to access our UNT Digital Library  Ongoing discussions such as the recent UNT Libraries Tech Talk   Library on the Go  A Candid Look at the Deployment of  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Phillips   Alemneh   Data Desiccation  Facilitating ETDs Access   Preservation  Mobile Technology in the Library  help staff understand users  their mobile devices  the market share of various operating systems  and related trends that influence the use of digital resources  The multiple format access strategy facilitates access using mobile devices because browsers have the built in capability to display images  but PDF documents require external applications or plug ins which may or may not be present  In terms of loading time  the rendering of a PDF document happens only after the complete document is downloaded while images can be streamed in  Improving Access Via Desiccation A primary reason UNT decided to engage in this data desiccation process was to provide additional methods of access to the University s ETDs  this improved access manifests itself in two distinct ways  First the Aubrey delivery application exposes the page level OCR text to an increasing number of search engines interested in crawling this content  Second  the user interface provided by the system can take advantage of new and innovative ways of presented paginated book content such as the many image based page turning interfaces such as the GNU Book interface or other interfaces designed for emerging mobile devices such as the iPad or other handheld tables  The user interface in the UNT Digital Libraries has an integrated page turning interface  which provides users with highlighted search terms and other features such as rotation and image magnification  In addition to these new forms of access the originally deposited PDF that is considered to be the  master  format is indexed and available to the end user if that is the preferred method of access  UNT expects to complete migration of ETDs by spring 2012  Data will be collected to see if desiccated ETDs receive more use than the older  single format PDF versions did  Considering the synergies of numerous emerging trends   such as the global development of open access repositories  explosive growth of mobile technologies  cross discipline collaborations  inter institutional data sharing  etc    the result of all of this work is expected to be an overall increase in access to the ETDs in the UNT Digital Library   Figure 3  Facilitating ETDs Access Via Multiple Formats  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Phillips   Alemneh   Data Desiccation  Facilitating ETDs Access   Preservation  Improving Long term Accessibility  In addition to providing new methods of access to the ETDs  the authors believe that the long term preservation and accessibility of these documents is being improved through the use of data desiccation methods  It is obvious that a JPEG image based version of a PDF does not provide many of the basic functions available in the master format such as linking  notes  and advanced multi media capabilities  Despite this fact  the authors believe that simultaneously moving multiple formats into the future will allow the documents to be rendered and access in the future  Providing multiple options certainly  facilitate and promote long term accessibility  The time consuming process of conversion in the present allows for various format migrations by automated means in the future  and it should be highlighted again that during the conversion process there were many issues that required manual intervention to resolve  This would need to be completed in the future where the likelihood that available software tools will support all features available in the PDF document format is unlikely  In addition to the JPEG version of the document  the OCR text can be used to create a simple text version of the publication even though it is has many levels of functionality removed when compared to the original version  A simple text version of the publication would not provide access to tables  drawings or illustrations but in a hypothetical situation where the other formats were rendered unusable  this would provide at a small level of access to the document   Future Work  The UNT Libraries feels that the continued use of data desiccation techniques described in this paper are generally applicable in the long term digital stewardship of content deposited and created by the university  These techniques are also being used in the UNT Scholarly Works collection  which acts as UNT s institutional repository and adds several new layers of processing from a wider set of deposited file formats  The Digital Library Division is actively seeking new solutions to further streamline the conversion process  there is discussion of a more automated process for matching pagination to the running image sequence and improved conversion tools for creating derivative images from the original PDF files  Finally there is work underway to convert the proprietary PRO format from the PrimeOCR server into the ALTO model used in many projects such as the National Digital Newspaper Program   CONCLUSION  The innovative use of technologies to provide increased access to and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations attest to the importance of these collections as the scholarly output of institutions of higher education  As an early adopter of what was to become the ETD movement in higher education  UNT encountered and overcame several challenges in the pursuit of providing greater public access to the scholarship conducted at the university  Users from around the world engage with the ETDs created by students at UNT  and as UNT provides additional access points  it expects this trend to increase with time  Understanding user communities  their information needs  and their use behavior will help to move contents into the users  space and facilitate use of ETDs  The high utility of this collection warrants time devoted to ensuring its preservation and long term accessibility  Planning for an unknown future in terms of digital preservation can only be made easier by providing multiple options for long term preservation and accessibility to this important set of information   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South
