<fulltext>Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  ETD2011 Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo Dr  Shukrije Rama Kosovo shukrie rama gmail com  ABSTRACT  Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETD   which offer scientific information to students and researchers  are currently considered a crucial factor that influences the development and advancement of scientific research  Even though the ETD system is growing very fast and is implemented by many countries  this path in some countries still lacks the essential tools needed to foster innovation in the realm of digitalization  The aim of the research is to examine the contribution to the field of the ETD system in general  presenting its development and benefits  and to compare it with traditional management of these collections in Kosovo and region  which is far from any favorable attitude towards implementation of this system  The measurable parameters of this study are  examination of the international efforts to implement the ETD system within institutions  surveys with university units in Kosovo  interviews with representatives of the National and University Library of Kosovo  NULK  and the deans of the departments of the Public University of Prishtina  as well as interviews with representatives of national libraries of Slovenia  Croatia  Serbia  Macedonia and Montenegro  Other resources will also be used if necessary  The research findings indicate that even though the ETD system is very useful in library and university premises  there are still countries or regions that are far from taking any step forward  or they are rather unfamiliar with this concept  Since the process of digitalization of theses and dissertations is very important and complicated  the management structures of universities and libraries must possess a wide knowledge and a background in information technology  a type of expertise without which knowledge cannot be developed and transmitted to new generations  Those structures must initiate discussion on the ETD system among students  reviewers  faculty members  library personnel and other subjects which will be affected directly by theses and dissertations   Keywords  Theses and Dissertations  Digitalisation  Kosovo Education  Library  ETD system  INTRODUCTION  The concept of Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETD   which was first discussed 24 years ago  1987  at a meeting in Ann Arbor  Michigan and caught even more attention and interest during the last two decades  is being used currently by many universities  libraries  consortia  and other relevant research institutions  Today  this system  as a fast and effective technology  enhances the management of these collections in libraries and already proved to be successful in many countries  Nowadays  there are many universities worldwide where students are obliged to submit their dissertations electronically  in order for them to be archived  This type of creation and maintenance of the ETD database has a direct impact on the development of science  proper education and many other benefits mentioned below   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  THE BENEFITS OF ETD IN THE ACADEMIC TRIANGLE  STUDENT   UNIVERSITY   LIBRARY  The creation of a thesis and dissertation in the electronic format and their online publication brings several benefits  especially if we compare it with traditional processes of collecting and maintaining theses and dissertations  Firstly  the student can make his work available to faculty members and larger audiences  respectively to those who are interested in making research  Since it is in an electronic format  it will be accessed much easier and more frequently than paper based theses and dissertations  In addition  the save on printing and copying costs is important for student s pocket money  Secondly  universities benefit from the application of the ETD system  as well  In addition to the possibilities that students and academic community will have a 24 7 hour basis access  it is also expected that it will be easier to monitor and supervise the content of theses and dissertations in order to avoid any academic dishonesty  Thirdly  from libraries  perspective  ETD provides a solution to address its space requirements  With ETD no physical shelf space is needed  Further  libraries do not have to worry about circulation  shelving  labeling  bar coding and cataloging of theses and dissertations  Even though this system is growing rapidly throughout educational and research institutions and it is bringing major changes compared to the traditional method of submitting theses and dissertations at the universities  there are still countries which are far from this process and do not have these benefits  It seems that the common feature for these countries is digitalization without vision  Kosovo is not an exception since the new thinking of digitalization is only just emerging  THE CONCEPT OF ETD IN KOSOVO  It is well known that many library collections in the world have changed the size and shape of the information space available through the computer screen and have revolutionized access to information of all kinds and sizes to improve user services  thanks to the power and speed of communication technologies  But no similar services are offered by the Kosovo libraries and educational institutions  Library users in Kosovo are not using yet computer terminals to search online for the collections of electronic theses and dissertations  They use very little other electronic resources  such as e books  e journals  etc  In relation to the usage of electronic resources in the NULK  research indicates that 75  of the students do not use electronic resources at all  15  report  yes  we make use of the internet   while the remaining 10  confirm to be using Google and Wikipedia as electronic resources  Research conducted with students reveals the following data  74  of the students say they take their books and other supporting materials to the library  using it only as a place to read in peace  22  report using their own materials with those of the library in combination  Only 4  of the students make use of the library s material  According to professor Ismet Bujupi  unfortunately  university departments and colleges in Kosovo do not use electronic journals and rather get insufficient and inaccurate information from Wikipedia  Bujupi  2011   On the other hand  Gani Abazi who studied Health Care Policy and Management at Harvard University considers that  literature review is extremely important to be done through electronic mediums  so that the most up to date publications are reviewed  compared and analyzed prior to making conclusions on the outcomes or experiments and specific research   Therefore   libraries in Kosovo should get the necessary logistical support and in particular the necessary information technology expertise to design and implement components of ETD s in Kosovo    Abazi  2011  Leskinen  2008  p 20  points out that  at the time I was in Kosovo  the libraries were not in adequate condition  There were not enough books and academic journals  Particularly  satellite libraries lacked even basic books  This had consequences not only for researchers but also for teachers  professors  lecturers  and students  Use of the WWW did little to help the situation  The internet is not without problems  because publicly available resources could be personal and biased accounts without scientific credibility   Under the Law on Libraries in Kosovo  the universities and public libraries are considered to be prominent institutions which  collect  enrich  process  maintain and preserve their collections that belong to different fields of intellectual creation and different activities related to human experience and opinion in order to make them known and available for users who express the willingness to read  research and study these collections and also to leave these collections as a heritage to new generations   Law on Libraries  2003 6   According to Signori  Signori    it is the task of national libraries to preserve the intellectual and cultural heritage of their countries  Nowadays much of this heritage is expressed in electronic form and many national libraries have started projects to collect and archive electronic publications   So far  Kosovo libraries have not started the implementation of projects related to the collection and archiving of electronic publications   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  Even though theses and dissertations which contain research and knowledge of students doing PhD and Masters Degree at universities and higher education institutions are of primary importance to libraries and in general to this process  it seems that relevant institutions in Kosovo do not pay special attention to this matter  Their treatment under the new standards hasn t been decided yet  including the priority list of the education agenda in Kosovo  It seems that their handling based on a form and access have not been changed and transformed since the establishment and application of doctoral programs in Kosovo  The procedure now followed during the process of submitting and collecting theses and dissertations in Kosovo is as follows  The student is obliged to provide 7 copies of his work  hard copy   three copies are given to committee members  one is for his university personal file  one copy goes to the university library  one is for the students  and one goes to the national library   The university department maintains evidence of the defended thesis and dissertation and all required information for such work  but there is no electronic database where we could search for them easily   Zeqiri  2011   Based on the information obtained by the department dean   theses and dissertations remain archived and can be accessed by  administration personnel of the department  the secretary and the archivist  Further  one copy goes to the university library and it has been made accessible to interested library users    Kabashi  2011  If we take into consideration these facts then we can summarize that  the work of a student is not available online  open access is limited while the student spends money on printing and copying  On the other hand  the university library has only one copy  It is difficult to find it since there is no  at least an electronic database to show the titles of works  If we analyze the process of work related to Theses and Dissertations at the National and University Library in Kosovo  we come to the conclusion that the Library is still using traditional methods to archive and preserve Theses and Dissertations  Collecting of those works is carried out by the Department of Acquisition  Theses and Dissertations belong to the Special Collection  which means they are preserved in closed stacks and they are usually non circular  while only properly qualified  interested researchers can have access  So far  the library has no digital theses and dissertations  nor even in CD or any other digital format  According to Zejnije Qerimi  the person in charge of special collections   only scientific workers or candidates who are close to defend their theses and dissertations can access these databases  Presently  the Library doesn t have any plan to change the management of Theses and Dissertations    Qerimi  2011  Facts about Theses and Dissertations in Kosovo  The abovementioned findings generate these facts     Theses and dissertations are only on paper  placed on library shelves      The information on theses and dissertations  common database  at least  for paper based theses and dissertations  has not been made accessible to general public      Theses and Dissertations are not available  i e  they have not been made accessible to general public  At the NULK  they have been made accessible only to scientific workers  At the university departments  they have been made accessible only to authorized members of university staff and external examiners for administrative purposes      There is a lack of coordination and cooperation between the Library and universities  a lack of joint actions which might initiate any action for theses and dissertations  The ineffective cooperation between the main library in Kosovo  National and University Library of Kosovo  and the universities and vice versa is quite evident      There is no foreseen initiative to deal with ETD projects since the main library of Kosovo lacks the necessary capacities to function as a sustainable institution similar to other national libraries and based on international standards      There is no foreseen online database that provides access to digital collections  such as theses and dissertations for online viewing and to provide the associated metadata regarding the documents  e g  student and university name  year of graduation  document title  abstract  keywords       It has not been initiated  at least  yet any process to generate theses and dissertations entirely electronically  by using a word processor and or electronically composed software  known as Born Digital Items      There is no plan yet to convert theses and dissertations into electronic files through scanning      There are no promises to create any digital databases  namely  create a digital archive of theses and dissertations  The application of processes  techniques and protocols to preserve the scholarly records over time is being done in a  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  traditional way which is considered more preferred by university departments administration     The dissemination of electronic Theses and dissertations on the Internet is not expected and planned in the near future   THESES AND DISSERTATIONS MANAGEMENT IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES  Even though there is a worldwide trend to collect electronic versions of doctoral dissertations  including those that have been stored on digital repositories of university libraries  unfortunately  it seems that the neighboring countries of Kosovo are in a similar situation  The National and University Library in Zagreb  Croatia  at present has a bibliography of old collections of Theses and Dissertations  1880   1984  which are placed in closed stocks  and they are made available at the request of the user  In 1990 the bibliography of theses and dissertations was made available online but there are no online collections for distant access   Cindori  2011  A similar practice is used in Serbia  too  Such a situation is not desirable  Kosanovic  2011   The results of studies documented that extensive thematic bibliography remains unknown and hasn t been made accessible to the majority of potential interested users  There is a list of PhD s until 2006  which has been edited by university departments for years  Each record contains information on the name of candidates  dissertation title and number of pages  One can not search for this list  but it can be found only by respective university departments  In Serbia  theses and dissertations in the field of mathematical sciences are available in the full text form on the website of the Department of Mathematics  University of Belgrade  A list of doctoral dissertations and master s theses in the field of new materials of the Institute of Technical Sciences  SASA  can be seen on their website  some of the theses are available in the form of full text   In Slovenia  theses and dissertations are integrated into a general catalog  thus there is no special catalog  Sotoek  2011   There is a digital library in Slovenia providing free access to 686 doctoral theses and 125 master theses  As regards Macedonia  theses and dissertations are processed like all other documents which are available in COBISS through the OPAC  There is a special collection of them and they have been prepared and stored separately  However  theses are not digitized  Dadasovi  2011   In Montenegro  all universities within the academic units have graduate studies  as well as master s and doctorate degrees  The Central Library collects a copy of master s theses and doctoral dissertations  which are defended in Montenegro  Those works can be found  later on  in the electronic catalog  COBISS CG  as part of a joint catalog of monographs and serials   There is no digitalization of theses and dissertations on central library level or at the national level    Vraar  2011  If we compare the management process of the ETD services offered by the education and research institutions of Kosovo and the region  slight differences emerge between Kosovo libraries and those in the region  Ambitious declarations to have a bright future for the library found in speeches made by library representatives  in this part of the Balkans  are far from realization and a long time is needed to achieve satisfactory results  QUO VADIS SUCH SITUATION   Among contributors that have had an impact on this undesirable status of Electronic Theses and Dissertations in the Balkans is also the lack of cooperation between local and regional academic institutions  specifically in the issue of theses and dissertations  We can see that     There is no local or regional network in the Balkans  created by academic and research institutions  that would come up with a stand on theses and dissertations matter      The lack of online electronic databases of theses and dissertations on regional level increases the possibility of any eventual academic dishonesty  bearing in mind that Slavonic languages are 80  used in the Balkan region and people are very familiar with these languages      There is no interuniversity cooperation that could help detect any eventual similar work as in the neighboring universities   Individual work generates many threatens which seriously damage the quality of scientific works  A common fear is that this situation leads to a slight plagiarism amongst universities in the Balkans  Theses and dissertations management is a  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  very crucial field of cooperation which has not been explored yet by regional universities and institutional universities of Kosovo and it seems that academic cooperation has been marginalized   No space for scientific competition  If Higher Education Strategies in the European Zone are oriented towards access  values  quality and competitiveness in order to improve the quality of education  then  it is important to stress how much Kosovo educational and research institutions are dedicated to achieve these components  The lack of cooperation between education institutions of Kosovo and the region boosts the chances for plagiarism  bearing in mind that there is no mechanism that detects or monitors the topics and contents of those scientific works  It can happen very easily that the translated pieces of theses and dissertations from Slavic languages  be appropriated by modification and adoption of key elements  Perhaps the term  Copy Paste  is not appropriate to describe the  real science  in Kosovo  but it is often the case  Probably the best term to describe the situation in the higher education system and the situation of the research is  plagiarism   omnipresent in the academic domain in Kosovo  However  this term does not apply to all researchers  since some of them are very original and professional   Rama  2010  Thus  theses and dissertations are only on paper and they have not been made accessible to the public and  consequently  there are many opportunities for students to copy others  work and not be detected  or to cite those works  unless the author of the original work reads the copied version  If those works are available online  then  it is very easy to detect copy paste or translations and adaptations from other languages   CONCLUSIONS  1   It is necessary to promote ETD in Kosovo Higher Education System and the Balkans  through initiation of a discussion on ETD among students  reviewers  faculty members  library personnel and other stakeholders that will be directly involved in and affected by theses and dissertations   2   The availability of information itself does not ensure the visibility of that information  Information must be made accessible  Therefore  education management in Kosovo must start to think about the ETD project in order to guarantee visibility across all academic institutions of Kosovo  It is anticipated that the visibility and availability of this information will result in a wider dissemination both nationally and internationally with obvious benefits for Kosovo   3   It is important to initiate establishment of inter institutional academic alliances  which would contribute to the creation of mechanisms which strengthen cooperation and implement policies and actions that contribute to the theses and dissertations process   4   The regional cooperation  respectively  joint initiatives as a path to the achievement of quality in the Higher Education System of Kosovo and the region could reduce the gaps in theses and dissertations development  It seems that such option can not be achieved for the moment   5   Libraries and universities  on state and regional level  must ensure close cooperation with each other and promote and offer assistance for the supervision of the process of theses and dissertations   6   A database should be created  which will be available on the web and which will include accessible both digital materials and materials in printed form   7   Since every library receives annually several theses and dissertations in printed form  alternative strategies are expected to be developed through many different institutional arrangements  which can expand considerably the pool of ETD resources in order for them to be available for academic users  All university departments must ensure that theses and dissertations are sent to the library in a digital form   8  University and library management in Kosovo  in order to become as effective as possible  is supposed to have the following qualities  deep awareness of digital era in the education process  ability to accept new changes and to  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Rama  Theses and Dissertations Management Overview in Kosovo  initiate processes that lead to global education  readiness to create a positive relationship with universities and libraries abroad  capability to adopt new digitalization systems needed for students and scholars  etc  REFERENCES  Abazi  G   2011  June 07   Interview by e mail   S  Rama  Interviewer  Cindori  B  S
