Africa is changing  There is renewed recognition of the role that university libraries play as drivers of educational development  Most universities in Africa now request students to submit digital copies of their theses and dissertations  TDs  on graduation  Because of this  enormous progress has been made in ensuring that staff  faculty and students in universities in Africa can access the growing quantities of information resources now produced in these electronic format such as ETDs  It is worthy to note that AAU along with some other initiatives such as that of the International Network for Availability of Scientific Publications  INASP   supports African TDs by making its content accessible through their WebPages  SABINET  South African Bibliographic Network  provides access to Union Catalogue of Theses and Dissertations  UCTD  that renders bibliographic records of TDs submitted to universities in South Africa  This is a welcome development that has led to the availability of African TDs in the global knowledge pool  The Federal University of Technology  Owerri  FUTO  is among the three Technology Universities established in Nigeria in 1981 with the aim of producing and promoting sound basic scientific training as a foundation for the development of technology and applied sciences relevant for overall national development  Asiegbu  2006   All programmes and courses of the University including engineering  science  agriculture  and management and health sciences are rooted in technology  The University library is responsible for archiving all the undergraduate and postgraduate research projects  theses and dissertations as well as other indigenous resources emanating from the university  The Documents and Archives Unit of the Library acquires  processes  preserves and makes available for use all scholarly output of both staff and students  The importance of these resources to research cannot be overemphasized  Postgraduate theses and dissertations serve as the window to high level research carried out in the university and as high profile publications of excellent scholars in the making  They are very qualitative writing produced by the students closely supervised by professors  Despite the usefulness of theses and dissertations  TDs  to research  they lavish in obscurity in the University libraries and archives  Swain  2010   They are not optimally used in the university due to their low visibility and the difficulty in accessing them  Sinha  2006  as  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  well as circulation logistics problems  The increasing visibility and access challenges posed by print TDs in FUTO was initially addressed with the development of an in house cataloguing and classification scheme as well as continuing indexing on submission to the library  This approach provided inefficient and increasing personnel cost   time demand  The problems of TDs mutilation  plagiarism and duplication continued to rock the Library s TDs management as it advances in age  The advancement in technology which heralded electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  brought leverage to the problems of print TDs  The awareness on the possibilities of ETDs was created through the introduction of Database of African Theses and Dissertations  DATAD  by the Association of African Universities  AAU   The Library  Federal University of Technology  Owerri became one of the university libraries in Nigeria that migrated from print through low technology  Word processing  to EndNote technology TDs  These efforts and development from the policy level through implementation to use including successes  challenges and prospects are presented  THE ELECTRONIC THESES AND DISSERTATIONS INITIATIVE  Though literature abounds on the production and use of ETDs  the Library was unaware of the processes involved  Move to start ETDs production and use was made in 2005  when the Association of African Universities  AAU  donated a CD ROM of Database of African Theses and Dissertations  DATAD  to the University library  The content though bibliographic only was exciting  Only two Universities in Nigeria were represented in DATAD including Obafemi Awolowo University  Ile Ife and University of Jos  The database was developed with  Procite  software  Efforts to procure the software yielded no fruit  However  the Library Management did not relent on its desire to begin the ETDs project  The focus was to  1   Solve the problems associated with acquisition  processing  storage and use of print TDs  These include   a  Delay in movement of TDs from the Postgraduate School to the Library   b  Submission of incomplete sets of produced TDs to the Library   c  Difficulty in cataloguing of some TDs   d  Inaccessibility and low use as well as the nitty gritty in shelving of TDs   e  Increasing shelves demand for TDs storage as years go by   f  Preservation of aged TDs  and  g  The issue of TDs mutilation especially those with high impact factor  2  Benefit from the opportunities provided by ETDS to students  scholars  faculty and institution which include among others   a  Enhanced institutional visibility   b  Enhanced availability  accessibility and distribution   c  Ease of storage  backup and preservation   d  Reduced cost of production   e  Versatility in production and use   f  Improved graduate education through adoption of technology in production of research reports   g  Reduced duplication of research reports  and  h  Advancing the participation in open access initiative   McMillan 1995  Weisser  1997  Lang  2002 and Barua  2006   Determined to reap these fruits and move the University to the global platform  the Library management geared up to discuss the issues involved with a view to arm itself properly for the University wide debate on ETDs adoption  Issues Involved in ETDs  The mode of TDs production  submission and use in addition to the technology developmental level in the university  necessitated the Library management to consider some pertinent issues so as to justify its proposal and ensure a successful ETDs project implementation  They include  Technology  Production and Submission  Policy  Legal and Staff issues  Extensive discussion and brain storming was made on each of these issues  Technology  Consideration was given to the hardware  software and network requirements for the ETDs initiative  Hardware requirements which include servers  workstations  storage media  printers  digital camera  scanners as well as CD  DVD writers  Barua  2006  have been made available for library automation in the ICT Unit of the Library  There was no university wide network at that time but Local Area Network exists in the University library  Thus the Library proposed that initial implementation could start as e  submission to the Library  Software requirement became a very crucial issue since the University was unable to procure  Procite  or any other  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  ETDs specialized application  However  the decision was to convince the University to start ETDs production with the easily available word processing applications which can be converted to Portable Document Format  PDF   Other software applications like the use of Extensible Markup Language  XML   Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML   and other database platforms like Procite  Dspace  Greenstone could be adopted later  Barua  2006   Basic computer knowledge by students and faculty was not recognized as a challenge  The University had designed and implemented basic ICT skill training for faculty and students  Production and Submission  It was agreed by the Library management that submission of ETDs could commence with the adoption of little electronic enhancement as print text stored electronically on external storage  The online production and submission which incorporates links to materials on the World Wide Web or multimedia elements as well as full blown innovative hypermedia documents could be adopted as the project advances  Katz  2004   This idea is supposed to facilitate University management acceptance of the project and will encourage adoption by students and faculty  Policy  The University policy on responsibilities  decision making  philosophy and technical procedures involved in the production  submission and use of TDs need to be reviewed  The proposal was to substitute students  submission of four print copies with one print copy and four electronic  CD ROM  copies  The print and one electronic copy would be submitted to the library to ensure print archiving  Online submission and other enhanced technology will be adopted as soon as the University intranet is up  The Library ICT unit could help faculty and students to ensure standardized electronic production  Legal  The issue of Intellectual property right was the most critical  The University has always been silent on copyright ownership of TDs  It is taken for granted that the copyright is owned by the University as part of the requirement for the award of degree to its students  However  the ETDs will present a different challenge  The decision on this was left for the University community  Personnel  It was proposed that staffs that are knowledgeable in handling of TDs in the library  who are also skilled in ICT  will be involved  Consideration was also given to staff of the University ICT Directorate who will provide hardware and software support  The School of Postgraduate Studies  PGS  will always be there as a go between the faculty  the students and the library  Bandara  2002   Library Presentation to the University Community  Decisions on ETDs issues by the Library management were presented to the university community at two levels  The University librarian presented the issues and proposed approach to  a  The Board of Postgraduate School consisting of Vice Chancellor  Deans of Schools in the university  Representatives of academic Directorates and Students  b  The University Senate which includes the former and all the professors in the University  The two groups approved as follows  i   Initial production and submission of TDs in both print and electronic copies to the PGS for onward submission to the University library  ii  Print version of already submitted retrospectively digitized TDs and hosted in the Library server  iii  Copyright of the TDs belongs to the University as part of the requirement for the award of the required degree  Copyright must be indicated on the verso page of the TD during production  iv  Access to the ETDs be made freely to every registered or external user of the University library  v  Printed copies as well as collations of ETDs be preserved as backup in an event of technology problems  and vi  Other activities relating to the University ETDs  visibility and accessibility should be pursued  In 2006  the first set of ETDs was submitted to the library  These were collated to one CD ROM while the print formats were processed for preservation   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN UNIVERSITIES  AAU  INVOLVEMENT VEMENT  Following the University s efforts to enhance ETDs implementation  the University librarian was invited for a policy meeting organized by AAU on DATAD initiative in September  2007  Satisfied with his presentation on the University s efforts on the ETDs  the Schedule Officer of FUTO was invited for a training of the trainer workshop held at Addis Ababa in April  2008  Consequently   EndNote  software  a digitizer  a business PC as well as a monitor was donated for the FUTO ETDs project by AAU  The University also benefitted in further training on EndNote organized by AAU in June  2010 in Darkar  Senegal  ETDs Project Implementation using ENDNOTE  EndNote is a software that allows for full bibliographic information entry  metadata entry as well as full text access to ETDs  It is a complete departure from  Procite  which allows only bibliographic access  The implementation mode adopted was based on the university community approval and the facilities available  Yiotis  2006   EndNote was installed on the University library server in September  2008  Access to the EndNote database is provided to ETDs users through the workstations  Students  TDs are received from the Postgraduate School  PGS  by the University library in two formats namely  electronic and print copies  Print copies are processed following the traditional method and indexed as backup  The life cycle of the FUTO ETDs from production to access on EndNote as well as retrospective electronic conversion of back issues is presented in Figure1  This could be referred to as low technology or offline adoption of Virginia Tech ETD project and that of University

ETDs  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  Three major steps involved are   a  Preparation and Submission or ETDs collection as indicated by Barua  2006    b  Processing  and  c  Access Provision  Preparation and Submission  This follows the steps provided by  Bandara  2002    Sinha  2006  and  Weisser  1997  with modifications   I   Students prepare their TDs using word processing software  Other applications are acceptable provided the installation file is included as part of the submission  They are encouraged to convert TDs to PDF and submit offline in four CD ROM and one print copy    II   ETDs are approved by Postgraduate School Board    III   Approved ETDs and print copies are batched to the University library   Processing  Two types of processing are carried out to ensure availability of TDs  They include processing of digital born TDs and retrospective processing of the digitally converted copies which were submitted as prints  Print copies accompanying the CDROM are moved to the Documents and Archives unit for traditional processing  Each of the CD ROMs contents are certified and possibly converted to PDF in library  The contents are copied to the Library closed access server  Individual CD  ROMs are archived  ETDs are catalogued and classified based on the EndNote metadata specifications as indicated in Figure2 to include author  title  year of publication  supervisor  town   country of publication  description  discipline  DOI  gender  degree  acronym  call number  keywords  abstract  location URL  file attachment  availability and address  language  DATAD identifier   Figure 2  EndNote Data Entry Interface Retrospective digital conversion of the earlier submitted print copies is carried out with digitizers  Digitized copies are transferred to the Library closed server  These are catalogued and classified based on EndNote specifications  Backup is created on external storage  Processed ETDS on EndNote are periodically batched to AAU DATAD initiative  Access Provision  Two levels of visibility and accessibility are available for FUTO ETDs  These are from   a  The University library Network  and  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri   b  The AAU DATAD search page  From the University library network  five workstations are provided through which EndNote database could be searched using title  author  Keyword  Degree  Year of Award  Department  Discipline etc  Search result provides opportunity for full text download of the required ETD  The DATAD of AAU enhances the visibility and accessibility of the University s ETDs by hosting it on the Internet  On registration for login  DATAD webpage provides search opportunity for the ETDs of Member Universities using same search term as from the Library s Local Server  SUCCESSES  Though ETDS implementation efforts in the University could be regarded as being at a primordial stage  it has benefitted the University  library  faculty and students   researchers  Generally  all theses and dissertations submissions from 2006 to date are electronic  Fifty percent of the print TDs submitted before 2006 have be digitized  One Hundred and sixty four  164  ETDs have been batched to AAU for DATAD initiative for hosting on the Internet  All processed ETDs  420  are accessible from the University Library Intranet  These successes are of immense benefits to the stakeholders  The University  As part of the benefits of ETDs initiative  the university is opportune to participate in the global open access initiative  DATAD provided global visibility to the university  It promoted their research profile and created avenue to unlock their indigenous information resources  This will in the near future enhance the institution s  webometric  ranking  Faculty  Faculties in the university are not only directing their students on the production of ETDs  They are also involved in their production thereby enhancing their digital technology skills  Faculty has bibliographic and full text access to all the research reports produced by their students  Consequently  research topics are tracked easily  Duplication as well as plagiarism is minimized  Storage and preservation of supervised TDs in electronic format has become a lot easier  Students  Following the low technology adoption for ETDs in FUTO  students are considered to benefit most in the areas of production and use  They are exposed to technology based model of ETDs which sensitized their inquisition on other means of incorporating technologies to TDs such as multimedia s enhancement and hyperlinks  Yiotis  2006   Many have become more flexible and creative by the production of auto run hyperlink content CD ROM  These are reserved for single user services in the Library  Cost of production is highly reduced through the substitution of multiple print copies with multiple CD ROM  Money is saved from buying papers as well as in providing bound copies  Barua  2006   Students are motivated to produce qualitative ETDs and eschew plagiarism as a way of boosting their image when the resources are finally put online  Issues related to availability and accessibility have taken a different dimension  As noted by Vijaykuma and Murthy  2001  ETDs are easily located  readily accessible and delivered over the web  ETDs are not only available in the form acceptable by the present generation  Blackburn  Starky   Wise  2009  but can be use  intranetly  independent of the library staff assistance through the workstations  This has resulted to the increase and diverse use without restrictions  time wise   The temptation of mutilation and pilfering are highly reduced  Access has become versatile in terms of time  location and search terms  The ease of access has improved the students  appreciation of scholarship and their emulation  It is easier for students to identify over flogged research areas  gaps in research and recommendations upon which they could build their own research  Multiple accesses have reduced access and use time  Search has become a lot easier with titles  authors  year of production  departments  schools  keywords The University Library  The Library has reaped the benefits of their ETD initiative  The impediments associated with acquisition of TDs from the PGS are overtaken  PGS ensures timely batching of ETDs to the library for verification before students  graduation  The processing cost is highly reduced  ETDs are processed into the library server onto EndNote  The print copies do not  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  require shelving rather they are stocked away in the archives  No cost in terms of staff time and money is incurred as regards preparation of indexes  provision of index cards and cabinet as well as in serving users or shelving used copies  Metadata entries using EndNote has facilitated processing  The application suggests entries based on already existing ones  The problems associated with issuing and return of TDs in addition to  misshelving   theft  mutilation has become a thing of the past  Consequently  the library can boast of possessing for posterity all ETDs  born and scanned  produced in the university  Above all  library services with reference to TDs have improved tremendously  CHALLENGES  Despite the successes and benefits derived so far  ETDs initiative in FUTO is bedeviled with many challenges  These are not far from the impediments identified in Arab Gulf states by Alsalmi  nd  including technological factors  legal issues  absence of strategic plan for ETD network conservation  lack of TDs acquisition process polices  lack of experienced personnel and other technical issues  The manifestation of these problems however differs as noted by Alhaji  2007   Technological Factors  The University community has limited access to ETDs server  This is as a result of yet to be completed university wide intranet  Thus ETDs are submitted offline using CD ROM  Consequently  gap still exist between production submission and access  Furthermore  the university is yet to access all ETDs uploaded to DATAD  The technical logistics in terms of IP and AAU membership update is yet to be fully addressed  There is the difficulty of getting a prototype of retrospective print on digital form  As a technology university  print TDs are dotted with myriad of graphs  images  charts and program codes that fail to emerge clearly upon scanning  Special symbols pose a lot of problems during EndNote entry  Legal Issues  Interview with the University librarian reveals that copyright issue has been resolved  The approval is that copyright belongs to the University  However  there is no written agreement with each of the student to that effect  Furthermore  it appears that some students continue to publish part or a whole of the ETDs as journal articles or book either before or after the university has taken possession of the ETDs  This is likely to create some legal problems in future  Some students included graphics and other copy righted materials without permission from the owners  Absence of National Plan for ETD Consortium  Lots of scholarly research is carried out in Nigerian universities  If well harnessed  they could facilitate national development  However  many universities are yet to embrace the ETDs initiative while others are advanced  Nigeria as a country has not given it a thought with a view to having a national database of ETDs  A program of this nature will encourage universities that are yet to embrace the initiative  This will further advance discussion on issues  successes and problems that are peculiar to each institution and the country at large  Personnel and Users  Technology changes by the day  Competencies of today will be moribund tomorrow  Advance application of ETDs is based on the competencies of the personnel and other stakeholders including faculty and students  Unfortunately  the advance competencies needed by library personnel such as multimedia enhanced ETDs and hyperlinking is yet to be developed  Furthermore  the well advanced faculty  professors  is still skeptical about technology and TDs  Most of them who are at the policy making level in the university discourage furthermore efforts to move ETDs from the present level to advanced level  Inadequate Power and ICT Infrastructure  The university is yet to appreciate that the life cycle of ETDs is dependent on the availability of electricity  as well as computer and communication technologies  Inadequate power supply slows down retrospective digitization and processing of ETDs into Endnote  Poor maintenance culture as well as the policy of depending on contractors for ICT maintenance in the library reduces the speed at which ETD life cycle is completed  Users are often discouraged as access is denied  Other Technical Issues  Retrospective digitization of TDs in print requires disintegration of the bound copies and rebinding afterwards  This leads to  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Anunobi et al  ETDs Initiative in Federal University of Technology Owerri  damage  in some cases  poorly scanned copies  Often ETDs submitted to the library are not converted to PDF and some are submitted in applications unavailable in the Library  Access to such ETDs is denied  while others have their scientific and technical symbols distorted  The Library server has once been exposed to virus issues  Consequently  data was lost in a bid to restore with backup   THE FUTURE  Though the university has taken a step beyond the traditional TDs  a lot needs to be done  There is no doubt that the future is promising  The technology  EndNote  provided by AAU will continue to be a necessary platform for global availability of FUTO ETDs as well as other indigenous resources  It is also expected that EndNote will be upgraded to accommodate multimedia submissions  However the Library management is not relenting until full multimedia ETDs are achieved  The University Librarian advanced that plans are on the way to convince the stakeholders for training on  a  Use of multimedia resources and production of multimedia enabled ETDs  b  Use of Standard Generalized Markup language  SGML  and Hypertext Markup language  HTML   c   Training on the submission process as well as ETDs use   It is expected that the completion of the university intranet will usher in online submission of ETDs  That will also ensure university wide access  The university will streamline the intellectual property issue and ensure compliance of the stakeholders in form of written submission on copyright ownership  It is expected that before the end of 2013  all TDs in FUTO would have been converted to ETDs  This implies that funds will be made available for acquisition and maintenance of digitizing facilities  organizational flow of the Digitization unit enhanced  and zealous   enthusiastic staff who are ready to move with technology deployed to achieve this target  The only global window to the FUTO ETDs is the DATAD project  Hence all efforts are on the way to comply with the requirements of the project  The University will continue to modify the teaching  learning and research policy as well as embark on promotional strategies with a view to changing the perception and attitude of the pessimistic faculty on ETDs  Traditional learning has metamorphosed to e  learning  Traditional ETDs migration to ETDs is a no go back  Nigerian University libraries should embrace it and utilize opportunities provided by AAU through DATAD initiative  CONCLUSION  The future of digitization of theses  dissertations and digital resources management in FUTO Library is quite promising  The use of EndNote application has not only placed the Library efforts in the right footing but has also provided room for continuing support from AAU and collaboration with other libraries that are involved in such project   REFERENCES  Alhaj  I O   2007   Digitization of past question papers  dissertations and theses  a case study of 30 Nigerian university
