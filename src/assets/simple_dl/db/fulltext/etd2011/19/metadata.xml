Charles Greenberg Yale University charles greenberg yale edu  Austin McLean ProQuest austin mclean proquest com  ABSTRACT  Plagiarism is a significant issue on campuses around the world  Ensuring the originality of PhD dissertations and Master s Theses has been undertaken using a variety of different means  However  a comprehensive overview of the landscape of originality assurance had yet to be conducted  This paper provides the most current review of the plagiarism issue and how universities are addressing it  Results of an environmental assessment of nearly 300 graduate students  faculty  librarians  and academic administrators are provided along with an overview related to universities  education of students and faculty about the plagiarism issue  Data from the survey sheds light on both attitudes toward plagiarism and how plagiarism is addressed on a university and classroom basis  In addition to presenting the results of the survey  discrepancies found on a subject basis as well as differences between the groups studied are discussed  Finally  this paper recommends areas for future research  Keywords  Required   Plagiarism  originality assurance  institutional repository  IR  patch writing INTRODUCTION  Every university based electronic thesis and dissertation  ETD  program assists faculty by documenting student scholarship and  when necessary  verifying the authenticity of the content in their repository on behalf of their institution  While there are many ways of approaching this effort  a comprehensive overview of the landscape of originality assurance has yet to be undertaken  This paper aims to provide most current 2011 review of the issue and how universities are addressing it  The topic of plagiarism in higher education provides a starting point and common denominator when discussing authenticity of student scholarship  Journal articles  conference papers  theses  and even the popular press have written about this topic often   Schaefer  2010  Rogers  2009  Bouman  2009  Eckel  2010  Garnica  2010  Typically  treatment of this topic is definition based   what is plagiarism    Schaefer  2010  Bouman  2009  Anonymous  2009a  or solution based   how to solve the problem of plagiarism     Malgwi and Rakovski  2009  Ragusa  2009  East  2010  However  there have been few studies that have looked at what universities are doing to minimize plagiarism  The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of how universities are educating students and faculty about the issue and report on the environmental assessment survey which sought responses from a representation of students  faculty  librarians  and academic administrators  Data representation of notable results will allow the authors to highlight discrepancies found on a subject discipline basis  In addition to presenting the results of the survey  the paper discusses discrepancies within subject disciplines and amongst the groups studied  An insufficient number of undergraduate student survey responses were received to either report on or draw any hypothesis about undergraduate teaching or student behavior  In addition  the relatively small survey response in some disciplines and user groups may not meet a test of statistical significance  METHODOLOGY  A survey was conducted in May of 2011 among faculty  academic administrator  graduate students and librarians  A Google DocTM form at a stable URL served as the data collector  automatically feeding submissions into an exportable spreadsheet  A call for participation was made to several listservs with an Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Greenberg   Mclean  Where Sharing Should Not Go   explanation and link to the survey form  Distribution lists included ETD L  listserv run by the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations   CGS L  listserv run by the Council of Graduate Schools   and a variety of announcements and links to the survey distributed though social media  primarily TwitterTM and FacebookTM  Motivation for completing the survey on a voluntary basis was provided by offering two randomly drawn gift certificates  Each respondent s email address was collected for the purpose of the drawing  Prior to data analysis the email address was separated from the survey results  The survey questions intentionally excluded demographic data or other means of identifying participants   The accuracy of self submitted demographic or institutional data could not be verified in this study design      275 participants completing the survey  Ambiguous  incomplete  or irrelevant survey results were removed from the analysis  leaving 268 survey results for analysis  Graduate students were the highest number of participants  Figure 1   Greenberg and Mclean  2011i   followed by faculty and librarians  Academic administrators were also invited to participate in the survey  Subject discipline among participants was reviewed as part of the analysis   Figure 1   Greenberg and Mclean  2011i  Among graduate students  those in the arts and humanities had the highest participation  followed by basic or laboratory sciences  Engineering and social science business also had strong participation rates  Faculty in the social sciences   business areas had the largest participation  with health sciences  basic   laboratory sciences and humanities and the arts also having strong showings  Among librarians  those in the health sciences made up the largest subset  One author s work as a health sciences librarian and his use of social media for promotion is probably responsible for unbalanced subject discipline librarian participation   Figure 1  Survey Responses Analyzed  n 268  RESULTS  Respondents were questioned about their knowledge of an explicit plagiarism copyright policy posted on a university website  repository or course management system   Figure 2   Greenberg and Mclean  2011o  The majority of respondents  n 193 or 72   indicated awareness of a policy  though nearly 28  did not  In an age of ubiquitous electronic scholarship and publishing  one could be concerned about the minority report with no immediate awareness  At the same time  many students  faculty  and other professionals can readily search their campus web site  if a policy needed to be located  More than 70  indicating immediate awareness demonstrates active discussion and advice on this topic is taking place  Respondents were asked whether they believed that PhD dissertations or master s theses were more likely to be plagiarized when available electronically   Figure 3a   Greenberg and Mclean  2011p  Results from faculty were evenly split  with 24 faculty indicated an increased risk of plagiarism and 23 replying that plagiarism risk was not increased  There were several areas where there was marked disagreement of viewpoints  The results indicated that 3 out of 5 faculty members in social sciences or business  SO  believed that plagiarism was more likely to occur  while 5 out of 7 faculty members in basic sciences  BS  held the view that plagiarism did not increase along with availability  Several recent papers acknowledge a faculty belief that electronic thesis availability promotes plagiarism   Abrizah  2009  Saldana Gastulo et Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Greenberg   Mclean  Where Sharing Should Not Go   al   2010  Yiotis  2008  Junic  2009  When comparing these findings to results from the students  the authors find that unlike faculty  there was similarity among those in SO and humanities  HU    Figure 3b   Greenberg and Mclean  2011q  The largest difference in opinion appeared among those in HU  where students that did not believe ETD repositories increased plagiarism outnumbered those that did  by a ratio of 3 to 2  Students in BS  Engineering  EN  and SO had a similar balance of opposing viewpoints  In constrast to their responses regarding the potential threat of plagiarism in the electronic environment  students expressed significantly less concern about their own writing being plagiarized    Figure 4   Greenberg and Mclean  2011e  There was a greater substantial majority  by an average 2 to 1 ratio  which did not fear plagiarism of their own work  It s possible to hypothesize that  having grown up in a culture of sharing music  books  or opinions through social media  students are less sensitive to the idea of plagiarism  Nor do they have the professional experience to comprehend the personal consequences for misuse of their scholarship  Awareness of an institutional repository stood at 53    Figure 5   Greenberg and Mclean  2011r  However  a significant number of respondents were not sure if a repository existed on their local campus  Few respondents reported that their university did not host an institutional repository  Re use of one s own original content is commonly viewed as plagiarism in the literature  Anonymous  2009b  Bretag and Mahmud  2009  Chalmers  2009   However  among faculty  the survey found that awareness of re use as plagiarism was not as widely held as generally imagined   Figure 6a   Greenberg and Mclean  2011f  Only faculty in SO shared this common opinion  Faculty in other disciplines were much more evenly split  with some faculty  such as those in BS and O  indicating that re use was not plagiarism  This result indicates that universities should spend additional instruction time ensuring those faculties are aware of the common perception of reuse as plagiarism  lest their university have potentially embarrassing occurrences on their campuses  When compared with faculty responses  students had a much stronger view of re use as plagiarism   Figure 6b   Greenberg and Mclean  2011g  Students in BS  EN  SO and O viewed re use as plagiarism  with those in BS and EN expressing this view by a wide margin compared to other disciplines  Students in HU did not view re use as plagiarism by nearly a 3 5 ratio  This contrasts with faculty in HU  who do view re use as plagiarism  The limitations of a small sample size also limit the strength of this evidence  though we hope it can promote discussion and motivation for further study    Incidents of plagiarism were said to be fairly common on campuses  with a majority of administration  faculty  graduate students and librarians all indicating that they were aware of at least one plagiarism issue at their university   Figure 7   Greenberg and Mclean  2011h  Graduate students  by a margin of nearly 2 to 1  said that they were aware of these incidents  while librarians by a margin in excess of 4 to 1 were aware of such instances  Interestingly  almost 1 3 of administrators were not aware of instances of plagiarism  meaning that this group may not have been made aware of the incidents of plagiarism that occurred on their campuses  Librarians clearly are in the forefront of knowledge regarding plagiarism occurrences on campus  Of those who were aware of an incident of plagiarism on campus  more than 2 3 found the university s response to be either adequate or appropriate  figure 8   Greenberg and Mclean  2011s   Nearly 1 3 found the response to be inefficient  and a small number found the response exemplary  Faculty  students  administrators and librarians were split fairly evenly along these lines  The authors conclude that at most universities  faculty  students and staff believe that incidents of plagiarism are being handled appropriately  PATCH WRITING  Patch writing  or  patchwriting   is a teaching tool where words  phrases  and sentences from sources are copied in either exact form or with few changes and mixed with a student s original writing   Linneman  2010 Rebecca Moore Howard is said to have developed this term  and described its use among English as a second language  ESL  students as a learning tool  Linneman  2010   For students that include patch writing as their own  Linneman concluded that this was a sign that the student was in need of instruction  She put forward the notion that the teaching should not be simply along the lines of a single instructional event  but should be included as part of the student s education in the long term  Abasi reached a similar Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Greenberg   Mclean  Where Sharing Should Not Go   conclusion  noting that institutional policies had a profound impact on student s approach to patch writing and plagiarism   Abasi  2008  Further  he advocated for seminars geared toward ESL students which would be held when the graduate students began writing in earnest  Based on this survey s results  faculty in the health sciences were the most concerned about patch writing leading to plagiarism  while basic or laboratory science faculty were the only group to believe that patch writing did not encourage plagiarism  Figure 9b   Greenberg and Mclean  2011u   Several disciplines expressed confusion around the issue  with those in the social sciences or businesses and computer science of information technology expressing the most uncertainty about the impact of patch writing on plagiarism  Participants from all disciplines believed that patch writing either did not have an impact or were not sure of the impact  In comparison to faculty  more administrators expressed the belief that patch writing did not contribute to plagiarism  with at least one administrator in the social sciences or business  humanities   the arts and computer science or information technology putting forward this view  Figure 9a   Greenberg and Mclean  2011t   Like faculty  there was considerable uncertainty about this topic  with those administrators in the health sciences and nearly all of the basic or laboratory science administrators indicating that they were not sure if patch writing led to plagiarism  Presumably graduate students engage in the greatest amount of patch writing  given the description of this type of writing as a way to hone one s writing skills  Perhaps due to this group s writing skills and experience  concern about patch writing leading to plagiarism was lowest among this group  Figure 9c   Greenberg and Mclean  2011v   The majority of those in other   multidisciplinary fields  as well as a fairly large number of humanities   the arts students  did not hold the view that patch writing led to plagiarism  Like administrators  100  of graduate students in the health sciences field were not sure if patch writing led to plagiarism  Those in humanities   the arts and basic or laboratory science were nearly split in their view regarding whether patch writing encourages plagiarism    Like administrator and graduate students  many librarians were unsure about patch writing and the affect on plagiarism  figure 9d   Over 50  of both health sciences and other   multidisciplinary librarians were not sure about patch writing and its affect on plagiarism  PLAGIARISM DETECTION SOFTWARE  The prevalence of plagiarism detection software on some campuses prompted survey questions around its prevalence and use among survey participants  Many universities use plagiarism detection software as a part of a larger campus initiative  This integrated approach is recommended by several in the literature   Boehm  Justice   Weeks 2009  Carroll 2009  Ryan et al  2009  Jameson 2009  In our literature review there were no reports of specific student knowledge of plagiarism detection software and its use on campus  Our survey found that over 50  of respondents did not know whether plagiarism detection software was used on campus  Figure 10   Greenberg and Mclean  2011a   Exactly 25  of respondents did know that software was used on their campus  and a nearly equal amount was certain that plagiarism detection software was not used on campus  The authors conclude that plagiarism detection software does not have the visibility that many assume  based on the amount of discussion that this engenders  Most graduate students reported that submission of class assignments to plagiarism detection software was not mandatory  Figure 11   Greenberg and Mclean  2011j   This finding runs counter to other studies which have indicated compulsory submission was a requirement  Further research will need to be conducted to understand how widespread this phenomenon is among universities  The finding of minimal required submissions using plagiarism detection runs counter to what the authors found in the literature review  where submission to plagiarism detection was mandated  Thurmond 2010  Rai 2010  Lee  Bani   Chen 2009   Most faculty were not required to attend or participate in plagiarism or copyright policy training  Figure 12a   Greenberg and Mclean  2011k   Only 20  of those in social sciences or business  29  of those in humanities and the arts  25  of engineers and 33  of computer science or information technology reported having a electronic or class based training program  Web based information provision and interactive training was the most popular form of plagiarism training Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Greenberg   Mclean  Where Sharing Should Not Go   for faculty  Figure 12b   Greenberg and Mclean  2011l   The survey found that nearly 85  of responding faculty were directed to a website to receive information regarding plagiarism as a method of instruction  Interactive tutorials conducted via the web were provided to 71  of the respondents  Only 29  of responding faculty had some form of face to face training  consisting of library instruction or group training  For faculty who received plagiarism training  over 50  of training was concluded in less than one hour  Figure 12c   Greenberg and Mclean  2011w   However  43  of faculty report training that lasted longer than one hour  The majority of graduate students did not receive specific training related to plagiarism  Figure 13a   Greenberg and Mclean  2011b   However  some disciplines did devote specific attention to this topic  Respondents in two disciplines reported a high degree of instruction compared to other disciplines  Respondents in Engineering  EN  and basic or laboratory science  BS  reported that over 50  had attending training of some kind  Humanities and the arts  HU  and computer science  CS  respondents reported similar findings  with 43  and 42  respectively receiving training related to plagiarism  Web provided training was also popular for instructing graduate students regarding plagiarism  Figure 13b   Greenberg and Mclean  2011m   All disciplines other than EN reported that web provided training  most frequently in the form of website information or handouts  was supplied   Interestingly  EN students reported that  other types of instruction  was the dominant method of training   Faculty group discussions and web based interactive tutorials were also popular methods of training graduate students  Library instruction was the least popular way for graduate students to receive instruction related to plagiarism  Graduate students reported that training typically lasted less than one hour for the majority of disciplines  Figure 13c   Greenberg and Mclean  2011c   The notable exception is with EN students  most of whom had training which lasted between 2   5 hours  50  or more of students in the BS  CS  HU disciplines had experienced plagiarism training which lasted between 1 and 5 hours  The survey found that the most widely used method for discouraging or preventing plagiarism was via a student agreement or code of conduct  Figure 14   Greenberg and Mclean  2011n   Website information and handouts was the second most popular method  71 respondents reported classroom education  while some respondents reported that no procedures or polices were in place  The final survey question asked respondents about the effectiveness of an institution s procedures and protocols used to prevent plagiarism  Figure 15   Greenberg and Mclean  2011d   Nearly 43  of respondents indicated that their university did an average job of preventing plagiarism  In a rather standard normalized distribution  nearly 31  of respondents indicated that their university s procedures tended toward  or achieved  effectiveness  and just over 26  reported that their institution was less than effective with plagiarism detection  CONCLUSION  This survey found that the majority of faculty and students  72   were aware of their university s plagiarism policy  and students reported a high amount of codes of conduct related to plagiarism  However  in most disciplines  for both faculty and students  where plagiarism was specifically addressed  the majority of respondents reported less than one hour of time were spent on the topic  There appears to be an opportunity for universities to provide specific instruction around the policies related to original scholarship  in order for students and faculty to become very familiar with topics such as self plagiarism and patch writing  Faculty librarian interdisciplinary instructional design collaboration can leverage expertise and interest in the authoring of local guidelines and self paced instructional models  The survey results also showed that Graduate students were more aligned than faculty with the belief that re use of their own material would be classified as plagiarism  This bodes well for the next generation of faculty not only being aware of this difference  but also likely to pass this belief on to their students  AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH  This survey found that most graduate students were not concerned about their work being plagiarized  Further  the majority of graduate students did not believe that making ETDs available in a repository led to plagiarism  With the millennial generation s ideas of sharing and privacy differing from earlier generations  it will be interesting to observe graduate students that transition to become future scholars  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Greenberg   Mclean  Where Sharing Should Not Go   Will their ideas align with or transition beyond previous generations  views on sharing  intellectual property  and copying  with or without intent  The authors suggest that future studies look more closely at the differences between faculty and students who received less than one hour of instruction related to plagiarism  compared to those that received 2   5 hours  Were incidents of plagiarism at colleges and universities with higher levels of instruction on ethical scholarly writing equal  less  or greater than those institutional settings where individuals reported less than an hour of instruction  The ability to tie amount of instruction with outcome could be used as a driver toward increased discussion and programmatic action to address plagiarism in academic institutional settings  Finally  there is evidence among students and faculty of plagiarism awareness  as well as awareness of prevention strategies for plagiarism in a variety of settings  Future surveys could explore methods for lowering incidents of plagiarism through programmatic responsibilities and instructional collaboration to improve awareness and compliance among graduate students and faculty  REFERENCES Anonymous   The
