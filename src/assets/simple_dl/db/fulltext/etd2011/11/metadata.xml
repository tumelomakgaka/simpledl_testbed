Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETD  portal has been developed in South Africa to provide access to a country specific collection of ETDs and  more importantly  to coordinate  manage  monitor and support the development of ETD programmes at the various universities  This portal required the development of a custom software solution  using a multi tiered simple architecture of complex components  It is argued in this paper that this tiered architecture  tightly integrated into a commonly used application operating system framework  is a good approach to develop such central repository architectures to interconnect into the larger repository ecosystems of NDLTD and similar organisations  Keywords  Required   ETD  OAI PMH  repository  harvester  portal  national archive  metadata  INTRODUCTION  Since the inception of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   many institutions around South Africa and the world have developed operational Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETDs  repositories  collectively amassing more than 1 5 million ETDs as of early 2010  7   Unfortunately  although ETD digital library  DL  collections are now widely available online  there are few cross archive services specific to ETDs  NDLTD and its collaborators manage a suite of international services but these are not easily replicable for more localised communities  such as the universities within a single country or discipline  ETD services in South Africa have reached the stage where almost every institution has a suitable repository and associated workflow processes in place  It has been recognised that completeness  sustainability and expansion are best served by a national archive  one aspect of which brings together the metadata from distributed source archives using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  OAI PMH  into a central portal  However  at the onset of the project  there was no readily available open source ETD portal management software to meet this objective  This paper reports on an attempt to create such a system  composed of 3 separable layers to support expansion and assist in future scalability  Initially metadata records for the ETDs are harvested and verified from a selection of remote repositories  These records then are stored in a local database that is accessible via the OAI PMH  Finally an instance of the Lucene  6  open source search engine is used to index the repository and provide a human usable Web interface that can be used to search through the metadata  This three part system allows a user to navigate through multiple different institutions  ETDs via keywords and browsing operations within a single portal  The metadata that the user discovers contains a link to the original repository and  indirectly  the original documents  On a global level  the system serves as a central repository for other  potentially larger  repositories  e g   that of NDLTD  to harvest from  allowing them to simplify the harvesting of a region country  PREVIOUS WORK  Initial efforts at providing a unified search system for NDLTD involved the creation of a federated search system  8   This system stored the search language and syntax of all the participating sites  Upon receiving a user query  the system reformulated it such that it could be used to search on each participant site  The federated search system would then return  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Webley  Chipeperekwa   Suleman  Creating a National Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Portal  the results from each site s search  but did not merge them  There were many problems with this approach  however  Primarily  it relied heavily on each participating member site  If a site was unreachable or changed its search interface  their results could not be obtained  If a site took a long time to reply  the search results would be delayed  Since each site provided its own form of HTML results page  there was no simple way to merge the search results  Furthermore  adding a new remote site to the system was a non trivial process  often involving the specification of a new search syntax and or language  These problems were partly addressed by the emergence of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  OAI PMH   2   The OAI PMH is a HTTP based client server protocol that provides an application independent interoperability framework based on metadata harvesting  The protocol is designed to facilitate incremental transfers of metadata in a simple and general way  Primarily  the protocol is designed for the transfer of metadata as opposed to the remote searching of metadata  This results in less interaction between remote sites in a distributed discovery environment  In practice this means that if a DL provides an OAI PMH interface to their ETD repository  a service provider can access their ETD metadata in a generalised and uniform manner  using less bandwidth and with greater stability of service provision  If a service provider wishes to use the ETDs contained in a DL  it must first harvest those records using the OAI PMH and then store them locally before using them  At a more general level  the OAI PMH allows for a system of interconnected components  each of which is essentially a digital library  DL   This mode of operation forms the basis of the NDLTD Union Catalog  1  and is data transfer mechanism used in the South African National Electronic Thesis and Dissertation  NETD  Portal  3   Similar efforts have been undertaken in some other countries e g   Brazil  9   United Kingdom  10   However  a common problem is the lack of reusable systems  While there are popular repository tools such as Dspace and EPrints  there are few popular portal creation tools  Thus  a further aim of the South African NETD project was to create a reusable set of tools  SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE  All components were written in Java  using Java Servlet Web technology hosted on Tomcat servers within an Ubuntu Linux platform  The system architecture is based on a complex component model  Each step in the process of providing a centralised ETD discovery portal forms a single and separable component that can operate independently  There are multiple reasons for this approach  Firstly  the scalability of the service as a whole is far greater with a componentised solution  For example  if the data collection is small  all components can run on a single server  However  as the data collection grows  each component can be moved off onto its own server  Additionally  with a componentised solution  if the solution needs to be updated or changed to suit a particular environment  the user need only replace the offending component of the solution  as opposed to rewriting the entire system  A final important feature of a componentised solution is that if any part of the system fails  the system as a whole does not  The system has been split into three distinct components  as described in Figure 1  the Harvester  the Repository and the Web Portal  The Harvester retrieves metadata from a set of ETD repositories  The Repository provides a set of machine access points to the metadata harvested by the Harvester  The Web Portal then uses the metadata and other services from the Repository in order to provide a unified discovery interface over all the repositories harvested  Prior attempts at designing such an architecture  e g   ODL  OpenDLib  have included service based components with finer granularity but this invariably leads to increased complexity at the component management level  This system attempts to strike a better balance between component size and functionality on the one hand and inter component management on the other hand  A further consequence of the complex component approach is that each component potentially consumes multiple machines interfaces and provides multiple machine and end user interfaces  The Harvester consumes OAI PMH interfaces from multiple source repositories and provides a database with a machine interface to the Repository in addition to an end user management interface  The Repository consumes the database interface and provides multiple machine interfaces  OAIPMH  RSS  Summary  to the Web Portal and other high level services  Finally  the Web Portal consumes all machine interfaces provided by the Repository and provides an end user interface for resource discovery  This many to many component interaction is arguably appropriate for well defined and repeatable systems such as national metadata portals that can be used in different countries and for different tasks   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Webley  Chipeperekwa   Suleman  Creating a National Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Portal  Figure 1  Diagram of the System Architecture Use of the OAI PMH  Much of this solution relies on the use of a standardised metadata transfer protocol  namely the OAI PMH  In order for the Harvester to easily retrieve metadata from various institutional ETD repositories  it must be able to use a single predetermined protocol that all of the repositories support  The widespread adoption of the OAI PMH by repository tools makes this possible  Without this standardised protocol  the harvester would need to support an array of different protocols in order to effectively harvest multiple repositories  This would complicate its construction greatly  The Repository provides a public OAI PMH interface  so that its records can be accessed in a standardised fashion by others  The Web Portal uses the OAI PMH interface offered by the Repository to access the Repository metadata  Harvester  The Harvester component of the system is responsible for collecting metadata records from a set of remote repositories  The Harvester initially performs a full harvest of each remote repository  meaning that it will retrieve all metadata records stored in the repository  Thereafter  the Harvester will only retrieve records that have been added since the last harvest date  thus effecting incremental harvesting  This is done in order to minimize the transfer of data between the repositories and the Harvester  All metadata records retrieved by the Harvester will be stored directly into the shared Harvester Repository data store  This is implementation specific  but the system defaults to using MySQL as the database layer  The Harvester performs simple validation checks on records as they are inserted into the database  This initial checking is required in order to ensure that no malformed records are passed to the Repository via the shared data store  The Harvester is typically run at set time intervals  which could be as often as hourly  but is more likely to be daily  ETDs are not a rapidly changing resource  and a propagation delay of a day from an institution s repository to the national Repository is generally considered to be acceptable  The Harvester also includes an end user interface to manage the list of remote repositories and the harvesting process  Using this interface  an administrator is able to add  modify or delete repositories and monitor the status of the harvesting of individual repositories  Repository  The Repository data store defaults to using MySQL for its SQL compliant database  The Repository retrieves records from the data store and makes them accessible via the OAI PMH protocol  The actual data store form and structure is transparent to the user of the OAI PMH machine interface  This OAI PMH interface is important for scalability because the national Repository might be harvested by another Repository higher up the hierarchy  such as a continental or international Repository  Such a hierarchical system of repositories and harvesters at an international level will result in minimum  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Webley  Chipeperekwa   Suleman  Creating a National Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Portal  duplication of records and minimal network traffic  The Repository also provides an RSS feed of the latest harvested records using the RSS 2 0 standard  Finally  a custom Web Service is provided to list a summary of repositories and the number of records in each  This service is meant to be consumed by a portal to provide an overview of the collection  Web Portal  The purpose of the Web Portal is to provide a human usable interface to the metadata archive  The Web Portal queries the OAI PMH interface of the Repository in order to access all the records it maintains  It harvests from the Repository into its own local database  Once the metadata records are stored in its local database it can process the records using Lucene  6  for search indices and MySQL for browse indices  Currently Lucene performs a full re index of the repository periodically as opposed to an incremental update  In future versions of the portal  this will be converted to an incremental re index  Lucene is integrated into the Web front end  which provides the user with the ability to search by keyword and by various categories  such as title  author  subject and institution  The Web Portal offers a Web based interface through which users can browse and search through the indexed metadata records  and find links to the original documents on the source repositories  Although the primary focus of the Web Portal is searching and browsing  it also encapsulates and makes all standard Web Services  OAI PMH  RSS  and end user services available to end users in a single location  Operating System Integration  All components store configuration information in the standard Ubuntu Linux configuration directory   etc   log files in the standard location   var log   and Web applications in the standard root Web server  This high level of conformance with one of the most popular Linux distributions will make it possible to package the application for software repository based installation in future  The system s complex components also map well to the granularity of software components already defined in Ubuntu Linux  where an advanced dependency management regime will ensure that installation of the Web Portal will automatically trigger installation of all pre requisites if necessary  Repository Harvester  MySQL  Java  Tomcat  Apache HTTPD   CASE STUDY  IMPLEMENTING THE NETD SYSTEM  Development of the open source South African NETD software began in 2009 and a fully functional implementation was completed in 2011  The software was instantiated at the National Research Foundation to create a single national portal for ETDs  www netd ac za   Eleven institutional sub collections were included in the portal at the time of writing  each of which had implemented an OAI PMH interface for their metadata repositories  Prior to this development  there existed no central point of access for South African ETDs  only non electronic documents via NEXUS   The harvester was initially configured with only support for oai dc metadata  for which it performs XML validity checking per record harvested  Additional metadata formats are planned to be supported in the future and the harvester allows for this multiplicity of metadata already  A MySQL database was created to store the harvested metadata records for the Repository Harvester  The Web Portal also uses MySQL for its data store  The front page of the Web Portal was developed as a simple servlet specific to NETD to bring together the various services and impose an appropriate CSS theme on all pages  In this initial implementation  all three components are run from a single server  but as the scope of the project grows  the components might be separated off onto different servers  Figure 2 shows the Web interface of the system while Figure 3 shows the Web interface of the administrative part of the harvester  AWStats was used to analyse the server log files of the portal after approximately 6 months of operation to monitor usage and the following trends were observed     There were usually 500 600 unique visitors to the site each month  with a total of approximately 43000 hits in the period from 1 January to 10 June 2011   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Webley

during the hours of 9am 4pm  local time   This implies that most hits were from South Africa and countries in similar time zones  such as most of Europe      A large percentage  approximately 30   of the hits came from South Africa      The site was indexed by 37 different Web crawlers      More than 80  of hits were to the main portal interface  The remaining hits were to the Web service

Dissertation Portal       CONCLUSION  The framework proposed in this paper represents a reusable  componentised system for the creation of a central repository and Web Portal  It can be easily generalized for use in other DL systems  and offers a balance between manageability and scalability  Due to the component nature of the system  it is customisable  and can be made to be extended and incorporated into other systems  Ongoing work is investigating the use of a Content Management System to replace the simple servlet front end  for example  The extensive use of the OAI PMH in this system is in line with the concept of an interconnected  hierarchical global ETD network  The South African part of this framework can easily be harvested by an Africa wide segment of the framework  which could subsequently be harvested by a global service  The advantage of this is that management is decentralised and occurs closer to the responsible entities  with automatic metadata propagation to higher levels  The implementation of this system in the form of the South African NETD project represents a proof of concept of the proposed framework  All code produced is being released under open source licences for others to reuse  adapt and extend  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  We would like to thank Alexander Van Olst for his work on the harvester portion of the software  Thanks also are due to
