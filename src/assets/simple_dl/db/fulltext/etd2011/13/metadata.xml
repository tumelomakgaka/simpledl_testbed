<fulltext>Dolan  Assessing Awareness of Open Access Among ETD Advisors  Assessing Awareness of Repositories and the Open Access Movement Among ETD Faculty Advisors Molly Dolan West Virginia University molly dolan mail wvu edu ABSTRACT  In 1998 West Virginia University became the second university in the United States to require electronic deposit of theses and dissertations  ETDs  from its graduate student population  1   With the program in place for over a decade  numerous faculty have been exposed to the process of electronic deposit in their role as faculty advisors to graduating PhD and Masters degree students  WVUScholar  the university s institutional repository  stores and shares ETDs with the scholarly community at large  Faculty adoption of WVUScholar  however  has been mostly non existent  With the end goal of increasing faculty awareness of and participation in the repository  the WVU Libraries conducted a survey of faculty who have acted as advisors to ETD depositing students  The survey assessed their existing awareness of the repository  its features  open access concepts and principles  and tried to answer the question   has the ETD program acted as an ambassador of open access to WVU faculty   Keywords  Required   Institutional repositories  open access  Electronic Theses and Dissertations  ETD  INTRODUCTION  For many years  the ETD and institutional repository communities have grown in parallel  Universities that were forerunners in mandating electronic deposit of theses and dissertations may not have had a strong faculty interest in deposit of their own work in an institutional repository  And universities that were forerunners in the implementation of repositories may have only recently begun to mandate ETD deposit for their graduate students  As these two communities unite and intermingle  common goals emerge  Repositories are the logical provider of ETD storage and dissemination  and both communities share the goal of long term preservation of content within the university library system  As more US funding agencies  including the National Science Foundation  NSF   2  and National Institutes of Health  NIH   3   mandate open access to research publications and data  the need for long term  persistent  access to faculty publications has grown  By providing faculty with a ready made storage and access solution in the form of the university s institutional repository  libraries can work with departments across the university to prevent duplicate data sharing efforts  By bringing their content under the umbrella of the library  the faculty will also reap the benefits of the library s mission to provide preservation and access  A goal of the WVU Libraries is to increase faculty participation in WVUScholar  Because WVU has mandated ETD deposit for graduate students for more than a decade  a large number of faculty have acted as thesis advisor or dissertation committee chair to students whose work is deposited in WVUScholar  To assess whether this has increased their awareness of repositories and open access  we have surveyed faculty who have acted as heads of student thesis or dissertation committees  BACKGROUND  WVUScholar was created in 1998 as a repository for the deposit of electronic theses and dissertations completed by the graduate students of West Virginia University  While originally maintained in tandem with a print deposit process  WVUScholar is now the location of record for student ETDs  As of August 2011  WVUScholar is home to 5223 ETD instances  With the move from WVU s home grown repository software to use of Digitool  ExLibris s repository system  the library sought to broaden the purpose of the repository to include content such as undergraduate honors theses and faculty publications  To date  however  faculty adoption of the repository has been almost non existent  Because WVU is almost uniquely positioned as a university that implemented mandated electronic deposit of theses and dissertations before recruiting faculty content for the repository  it seems helpful to survey faculty to see if the use of  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Dolan  Assessing Awareness of Open Access Among ETD Advisors  WVUScholar for ETD deposit over the last 10  years has made them better informed about the repository in particular and about open access issues in general  METHODS  The survey was sent to all faculty on record in WVUScholar as the head of a dissertation or thesis committee since the beginning of WVU s mandated ETD deposit in 1998  Faculty were asked to participate in a 19 questions survey designed to assess whether they had used the WVUScholar ETD interface  whether they use the repository as a way to access past students  dissertations  what they know about the repository in general  and whether they have published any of their own work under open access guidelines  or are aware that the option exists  The survey was made available on the web through Qualtrics  a survey tool developed by the WVU College of Business  and the participants were contacted by email  278 faculty members were invited to take the survey  with a total of 92 completing it  for a response rate of 33   31  of respondents were faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences  16  in the College of Engineering  15  from the College of Agriculture  Natural Resources  and Design  and 11  from the College of Education  with the remainder divided between other WVU schools and colleges  The respondents were almost equally divided among faculty who had significant  serving 10 or more times  experience as ETD committee chairs  moderate  5 10  experience  or light  less than 5  experience  69  of the respondents had served in positions other than the chair for 10 or more student dissertation committees  FACULTY AWARENESS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY  Faculty awareness of WVUScholar was found to be high  and 94  of respondents correctly identified that WVUScholar is hosted by the University Libraries  However  80  of these faculty have not used WVUScholar in any context beyond submitting approval of their graduate students  theses or dissertations  Of the 20  who have used WVUScholar outside the context of ETD approval  most of their interactions were limited to searching and reading students  dissertations  One professor consulted WVUScholar  when  he  did not get a copy  of the dissertation in print  At least one faculty member was aware of the embargo options offered by the repository  and used it to   make a  thesis unavailable for 2 years to protect data prior to publication   Only one faculty member mentioned the repository as a source of information he she used in compiling an annual promotion and tenure report  This faculty member used the repository to   compile  the list of student committees I served in during the academic year    Figure 1  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Dolan  Assessing Awareness of Open Access Among ETD Advisors  Perhaps the most striking result of the survey was that 57  of respondents  when they need to consult a past dissertation from one of their own students  still prefer to consult a printed paper copy that they keep in their office or department  Although these faculty members are involved in the ETD process  and so are presumably aware of the availability of searchable electronic copies  they reach for the source closest at hand  This suggests that ETD access has far to go before it becomes ingrained in faculty habits  Of the remaining respondents  19  search for the dissertation in MountainLynx  the university s library catalog  while 9  go directly to WVUScholar  8  to the NDLTD database  and 6  to either Proquest or a Google search   See Figure 1   While faculty were very aware of WVUScholar as a place to deposit ETDs  awareness that it could be a place to deposit their own work was not high  25  of respondents knew the repository could be used for graduate and undergraduate student work  but only 20  saw the repository as a place to deposit their own work  and only 17  were aware that the repository could be a home for any WVU related content   See Figure 2   These results are consistent with a 2007 survey of University of California faculty that found 82  of those surveyed were  not aware of  or  aware of but  don t know much about  istitutional repositories  4 5    Figure 2 In a 2007 article based on interviews with faculty at Cranfield University in the UK  Sarah Watson found that 25  of the faculty members who had heard of the university s repository had not deposited any of their own work there  indicating that  hearing about  the repository  does not equate to understanding its purpose   6   This correlates with the present survey s finding that  while almost all faculty have heard of the repository due to the ETD deposit process  few have realized that it is available for their own work as well  FACULTY ATTITUDES TOWARD OPEN ACCESS  Faculty were then asked about their knowledge  prior to this survey  about the concept of open access  30  of the faculty had never encountered the term before  Of the 70  of faculty who were familiar with OA  by far the most common source for their knowledge were colleagues in their own field   See Figure 3   A small portion of the respondents had learned about OA through a current or past university s library  and a few were introduced to the concept when a federally funded grant required them to share their results through open access  No faculty mentioned learning about OA through a formal outreach effort such as Open Access Week  suggesting that education efforts might be more productively targeted to faculty on a one to one basis  A 2007 survey of University of California faculty discovered that faculty knowledge of scholarly communications issues was inconsistent and varied  except when it came to issues touching on tenure and promotion  4   This suggests that education efforts will bear the most fruit when a clear connection is made between the benefits of open access in relation to promotion and tenure  And since tenured faculty are a trusted source about the P T process for their pretenure colleagues  education efforts directed at trusted tenured faculty will stand a good chance of spreading to other faculty members

Figure 3  Out of faculty who were familiar with OA  60  said they had at least one publication that was available through open access  In 92  of those cases  the publisher offered open access as a standard part of their publishing agreement  Only 8  of faculty members requested open access rights themselves as an addendum or modification to their contract   Figure 4  When asked about their attitude toward future open access publication of their work  91  of faculty were supportive   See Figure 5   Most supported the concept  but were not planning to make a special effort to ensure their work would be available through open access  which indicates that changing publisher practices might be the most fruitful method of ensuring open access to future scholarship  Of the 9  of faculty who were unsupportive of open access  7  didn t see any need for change to the current scholarly publication process  while only 2  had specific criticisms of open access  Faculty who felt open access publication was undesirable listed the following objections  concern with copyright compliance  sustainability  harm  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Dolan  Assessing Awareness of Open Access Among ETD Advisors  to traditional publishers  and the idea that  more information is not necessarily better information    Figure 5  Survey results indicated that funding agency mandates are raising awareness of and participation in open access  Of the faculty members who had published something via open access  11 had experience with both funders who mandated results be shared by open access and or funders who required a data sharing plan in the grant proposal  Another 14 faculty had experience with either one or the other of these situations  When asked where they planned to host and share the data for these projects  most faculty planned to either use a site hosted by the grant funding agency itself  or their own departmental website   See Figure 6   It would helpful for further research to look at what motivates the faculty to default to their departmental website when making data sharing decisions  Possible reasons might include familiarity  convenience  and perceived or actual control of the process   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Dolan  Assessing Awareness of Open Access Among ETD Advisors  Figure 6  When asked what type of content they would like to share and preserve online through open access  the majority of faculty were looking for a place to put the final published versions of journal articles   See Figure 7   Faculty expressed a clear preference for sharing post prints  89   over pre prints  43    but they were also looking for a place to share conference presentations  data sets  and audio video  The responses indicate that there are many faculty who would make use of the repository once they are aware of it  and if the upload process is easy to integrate into their workflow   Figure 7 CONCLUSIONS  This survey suggested several avenues for future research and faculty recruitment efforts  Foremost among these is the idea that faculty repository participation will only increase when there is a simple  hassle free way to integrate the deposit process into the scholar s normal workflow  Faculty are interested in the idea of a place to store their work  but do not seem to think of the library as the first place to look when they want to host such content  Education efforts targeted at individual  thought leaders  may be the most productive path towards increasing faculty repository participation   Proceedings
