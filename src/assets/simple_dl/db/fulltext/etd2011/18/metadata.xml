Janeiro  Rio de Janeiro  Brazil apavani lambda ele puc rio br ABSTRACT  This paper addresses the analysis of accesses to an ETD collection whose items are mostly written in Portuguese  It is concerned about examing if Spanish and  specially  Portuguese speaking countries are important readers of the works  This analysis for the whole collection is an extension of a previous work that innovates by breaking the problem in 3 subsets of data   ETDs in Humanities   Theology  ETDs in Social Sciences and ETDs in Science   Technology  The differences among the subsets are quantized and considered  so that accesses can be viewed in this context  This article also updates the index created in the previous work to identify potential readers in countries where either or both languages are official languages  An additional result is the identification of the differences among areas in terms of numbers of ETDs  of partitions of the works and of profiles of accesses  Keywords  Accesses to ETDs  accesses by countries  accesses by language groups  areas of knowledge  INTRODUCTION  Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro has had an ETD program since 2000  the first ETD was published in May  In August 2002  ETDs became mandatory to all graduate programs of the university  Over 99  of the ETDs are in Potuguese because theses and dissertations written in other languages have only been allowed in the last few years  The Maxwell System  http   www maxwell lambda ele puc rio br   that hosts and makes ETDs available has been an OAIPMH   Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting data provider since December 2002  The university is a member of both BDTD   Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertacoes  http   bdtd ibict br    the Brazilian national ETD consortium  and NDLTD   Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  http   www ndltd org    A previous study of accesses to ETDs with a special focus on Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries  Pavani and Mazzeto  2010  viewed the collection as a single unit with no separation in areas of knowledge  Available data were from June 2004 to April 2010  June 2004 was the first month when access logs were collected and processed to yield information on accesses to the collection  Access information is available to other digital contents that are available from the Maxwell System as well  This system is an institutional repository of PUC Rio  The analysis used 71 data sets   one for each month with information on countries  numbers of accesses by country  numbers of ETDs and average numbers of partitions  For each month  raw data were combined to yield other indicators used in the work  This paper is an extention of results of a subset of the analysis performed in 2010  Not all indicators are calcultated  but for the selected ones calculations address 3 subsets of the ETD collection  These sets are the areas of knowledge of each center of the university  The centers are    CTCH   Centro de Teologia e Ciencias Humanas  Center for Humanities   Theology      CCS   Centro de Ciencias Sociais  Center for Social Sciences      CTC   Centro Tecnico Cientifico  Center for Science   Technology    All centers have graduate programs and the oldest ones are in Science  Technology and started in the 1960s  In this work  once again  the focus is on accesses and languages but going beyond the collection as a whole  ETDs of each center are grouped in a subset named after the corresponding center  At the same time  14 data sets   from May 2010 to June 2011   are added  The reason for this is that these 14 months represent almost 20  additional data sets  These are the newest and bring more up to date characteristics of accesses  it is expected that they are more significant than the oldest ones  A second reason to include new data was the increase in the  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Pavani  Examining Accesses by Country  Language and Areaof Knowledge  number of ETDs available from the BDTD   Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertacoes union catalog  In December 2004  there were almost 5 4K metadata records  in December 2010  the number was a little over 150K  and  in Jun 2011  it was over 162K  A visit to the VTLS Visualizer  http   thumper vtls com 6090   shows that there are over 177K records of ETDs in Portuguese while the number of the BDTD colletion is approximately 137K  This means that other countries publish ETDs in Portuguese  As the offer of ETDs in Portuguese increases  it is expected that numbers of accesses to PUC Rio s collection vary since there is a bigger offer of ETDs in this language  so it is important to consider the newest data  Another change from the previous work is that the way the HDI   Human Development Index is computed has been modified by the UNDP   United Nations Development Program  this change is important in the expectations of accesses  Both topics will be addressed in later sections  An overview of the main characteristics of the collection is presented in the next section  It is important for the understanding of the treatment applied to access data   UNDERSTANDING THE ETD COLLECTION  The ETD collection of PUC Rio has some characteristics that must be addressed before accesses are considered  At the end of June 2011  it held 5 694 ETDs of  different generations   The first generation is of ETDs published between April 2000 and August 2002   each one was published in one single file except for being too big  at the time bigger than 1 2 MB  or for having some restricted content  In these cases  they were partioned to allow saving the file on a diskette or temporarily protecting part of the work while the remaining part would immediately be made public  Except for eventual partial temporary restrictions  they were all of public access since ETDs were voluntary and only authors who wanted to make their works public would participate in the ETD program  The graduate programs that had joined the program were in different areas of Engineering and in Business Administration  The second generation is of ETDs defended and published after August 2002   they are divided in many files  one for the initial parts  title page  abstract  table of contents  etc   one for each chapter and one for references and appendices  The third generation is of ETDs that came from retrospective digitization of theses and dissertations in Electrical Engineering  They were made available with the same policy of the first generation  but they differ because some may require more partitions for being image pdf files At the same time  the threshold for partition has been changed from 1 2 to 5 MB  Most of them are restricted because authors were impossible to be contacted to seek authorization for public access  As stated before  PUC Rio s ETD collection holds works from graduate programs in 3 areas  The 3 subsets are quite different in size and in the numbers of digital objects  In the last 8 years  students have been required to submit their ETDs in one separate file for each chapter  The separation by area of knowledge has shown that they differ in the average number of files per work  Table 1 shows some characteristic numbers of the collection when considered as a whole and for each subset  Data up to June 2011 were included because of the extended time frame  Numbers related as of April 2010 are mentioned because they were the end point of the previous work   Collection  CTCH  CCS  CTC  Number of ETDs   June 2004  1 171  233  215  723  Number of ETDs   April 2010  5 140  1 297  1 090  2 753  Number of ETDs   June 2011  5 694  1 442  1 291

in the last column of table 2 show that the Engineering graduate programs were the first to join the ETD  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Pavani  Examining Accesses by Country  Language and Areaof Knowledge  program and also indicate the Electrical Engineering did retrospective digitization of all its theses and dissertations   the numbers for the CTC subset are higher than the sum of the corresponding numbers in the other 2 subsets  The average numbers of partitions are important because  since numbers of accesses are counted in tens of thousands  it is possible to associate 6 930 accesses  to the collection  to 1 000 ETDs being completely accessed  this is an average number and does not mean that all accessed ETDs were completely accessed  The differences among the numbers in different areas of knowledge indicate that  if comparisons are to be made among centers  a normalization of data is necessary  Computations and or comparisons of results in a subset do not require such normalization  The identification of different profiles of ETDs in terms of numbers of partitions is an interesting by product of this work  It is important to remark that    Most partitioned ETDs belong to the second generation     First generation ETDs are in Engineering  CTC  and Business Administration  CCS      Third generation ETDs are in Electrical Engineering  CTC    For the above reasons  it is expected that the average number of partitions in the CTC subset be lower  The averageof averages number of partitions for the CTC set is 84  that of CTCH  The current relation  June 2011  is 88 61   no more first and third generation ETDs are being added to the collection  This may change in the near future because the Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering has been digitizing theses and dissertations that will be made available in the next few months  PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES  Information available under the title Most Widely Spoken Languages in the World  infoplease   2011  indicates that Spanish and Portuguese are  respectively  the 1st and the 3rd most widely spoken Western languages  English is the 2nd  When Internet users are considered  as available on Internet World Users by Language  Internet World Stats   2011a   the numbers of Spanish and Portuguese speakers rank  respectively  3 rd and 5th  The growth of the numbers of Internet users  between December 31  2000 and March 31  2011  is published under the title Internet World Usage and Population  Internet World Stats   2011b   The numbers show that Africa is the region with the highest growth rate   2 527 4   and Latin America and the Caribbean has the 3 rd highest   1 037 4   This is important because most es  and pt speaking countries are in these regions  If this trend is maintained  it means that more people in esand pt speaking countries will have access to the Internet meaning that potential of PUC Rio s ETDs readers may increase  An interesting aspect of Portuguese and Spanish is that they are quite similar languages  educated speakers of either one can manage  at least  to read the other  If scholarly information is considered  it is even easier  This is the reason this work addresses accesses from both groups  they are considered potential readers  Countries and Groups  Countries that have at least one of the 2 languages as an official language are classified in 2 groups  The groups are    Es speaking countries   Argentina  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Costa Rica  Cuba  Dominican Republic  Ecuador  El Salvador  Equatorial Guinea  Guatemala  Honduras  Mexico  Nicaragua  Panama  Paraguay  Peru  Puerto Rico  Spain  Uruguay and Venezuela     Pt speaking countries   Angola  Cape Verde  East Timor  Equatorial Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Macau  Mozambique  Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe   The countries in the 2 groups are quite diverse in size and in geographic situation  Portugal and Spain are in Europe  most esspeaking countries are in Latin America  most pt speaking countries are in Africa  some have large populations  Mexico  for example  has over 109M inhabitants  and others have small populations  Sao Tome and Principe  for example  has only a little over 162K inhabitants   East Timor was not included in the previous work due to reasons that are clearly stated in it  In the last 14 months  conditions seem to have changed and East Timor was included because accesses from this country have been observed not only to ETDs but to other contents too  Human Development Index  Another important difference among the countries is in human development levels   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Pavani  Examining Accesses by Country  Language and Areaof Knowledge  The United Nations Development Program created the HDI   Human Development Index  UNDP  1990   It  introduced a new way of measuring human development by combining indicators of the life expectancy  education attainment and income into a composite human development index  HDI    This index is available for most countries of the world  Data used by Pavani and Mazzeto were the latest available at the time  it had been published in October 2009 and covered up to 2007  At the same time  it is important to remark that the way HDI is computed has been changed by the UNDP  the latest published indices  UNDP  2010  were computed with the new definition  Up to 2010  education contributed to HDI with adult literacy rate  2 3  and the combined primary  secondary  and tertiary gross enrollment ratio  1 3   The 2010 HDI definition considers as its education component a set of 2 indicators   mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling  as presented in pages 13 15 and Technical Note 1 in pages 216217  UNDP  2010   This new definition lowered all HDIs when compared with the previous report  It is used in this work because its education component is more precise and this is important when ETDs are concerned  Once again  countries in the 2 groups are quite diverse in terms of HDIs  In the 2010 report  the range of indices is from 0 289  Guinea Bissau  to 0 863  Spain   ETDS AND POTENTIAL ACCESSES  Pavani and Mazzeto were concerned about examining accesses to the ETD collection from countries that are pt  or esspeaking  ETDs are a very special type of literature and some factors influence the potential accesses to them  The authors considered 3 factors  The first factor was the size of the country in terms of population  The level of education of the population was a second important factor since ETDs are highly specialized resources  the new definition of the HDI will be more precise to represent this factor  A third factor also considered was how easy difficult it is for the population to access the Internet  ETDs are made available from digital libraries   institutional repositories connected to the Internet  In order to assign numbers to expectations of accesses it was necessary to find an index taking into consideration the 3 factors  Seeking data was not an easy task   levels of education were very difficult to find since the available data  for all countries  referred to literacy rates  Besides that  the other 2 factors had to be measured at the same time for all countries under consideration so that comparisons were valid  Due to these reasons  3 decisions were made by the authors    To use the population of the country as one of the numbers     To use the HDI side by side with the country population because it contains information on living conditions  life expectancy and income  as well as education  it is measured the same way for all countries and the numbers had been generated at the same time  2009   Access to the Internet is dependent on the living standard too  This decision was maintained but updated   the new numbers for the HDIs and populations are used in this work  they are from the last report  UNDP  2010      To create an index that combined both the population and the HDI  The index was   I   HDI  x  Population    1    Table 2 shows the numbers for both groups  The numbers in the last row of each column are not the product of the ones in the first and the second rows   countries differ in both population and HDI   Total population Average HDI Index I  Es speaking group  Pt speaking group  420 281 000  57 858 800  0 707  0 527  309 420 871  25 114 111  Table 2  Index I for the Es  and Pt speaking Groups  Comparing index I for both groups it is easy to see that es speaking countries would yield 12 times the expected accesses when compared to the pt speaking group  The total es speaking population is almost 8 times that of pt speaking group and its average HDI is 34  higher  This was not what the results computed for the accesses to the collection as whole showed  This happened both in the previous work and in this one  Those from the pt speaking group were much higher  The next sections present the highlights of the results   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Pavani  Examining Accesses by Country  Language and Areaof Knowledge  ACCESSES TO THE COLLECTION  In order to understand the results of accesses to the collection and to compare them with the ones to ETDs in each area of knowledge  the next subsection addresses the way data were combined and analyzed  Grouping Countries of the World  From June 2004 to June 2011  users from 204 countries accessed ETDs  As expected  most of them were from Brazil  The second largest group was from the United States  Brazil was not considered in the analysis because it is the  home country  of the collection  The United States were not considered due to its large numbers of both Spanish and Portuguese speakers  including a large number of graduate students from all over the world  There were accesses from all the countries belonging to the es  and pt speaking groups  The decision was to divide the countries in the following groups    Brazil and United States   accesses from the 2 countries were not considered     International group   all countries that accessed ETDs except Brazil and the United States     Es pt speaking group   all countries that have one of the languages as an official language  as listed in a previous section  This group is a subset of the international group   The same grouping of countries is used to analyze data for each area of knowledge so that comparisons can be made  Accesses to the Collection  Some of the numbers presented in the previous work were computed for the new set of 85 months  The most important numbers related to the accesses to the collection as a whole are     Total number of countries of the international group that accessed ETDs   202     Maximum number of countries of the international group that accessed ETDs in a single month   143     Maximum number of countries in the es pt speaking group that accessed ETDs in a single month   28  the total is 30 because Equatorial Guinea has both Portuguese and Spanish as official languages      Number of months with 100 or more countries accessing ETDs   42     Percentage of accesses that came from the international group   8 48     Percentage of accesses of the international group that came from the es pt sepaking group   69 03      Percentage of accesses of the es pt speaking group that came from pt speaking countries   82 07      Percentage of accesses of the international group that came from pt speaking countries   56 65     Percentage of accesses in the int group from Portugal   49 74     Percentage of accesses of the es pt group that came from Portugal   72 05     Percentage of accesses of the pt speaking group that came from Portugal   87 89   The results showed that language seems to be an important factor in the accesses  Pt speaking countries accounted for a little over 82  of the accesses from the es pt speaking group though its Index I was  1 12  of that of the es speaking group  Accesses from pt speaking countries accounted for more than 56  of the international accesses  When the percentages of accesses from Portugal are considered  it is clear that they are dominant   almost 50  of all international accesses and a little over 70  of the pt speaking group  The population of Portugal is almost 11M in a pt speaking population of almost 58M  accounting for a little less tha 20   Portugal had almost 88  of the accesses from this group  It seems reasanoble to conclude that within the language group  HDI is a key factor  ACCESSES BY AREA OF KNOWLEDGE  This section is divided in 2 subsections  The first addresses accesses in each area of knowledge separately  they are analyzed in the same way the collection was  The second compares the way international accesses split among the areas  Accesses to ETDs in Each the Area of Knowledge  The accesses by area of knowledge are analyzed in 2 different manners The first repeats the same analysis performed for the whole collection but for each area of knowledge and the second compares results among the areas   Proceedings of

are interesting concerning data in table 3     Rows 1 4 contain absolute numbers and CTC shows the highest values among centers   this can be explained by the fact that the average number of ETDs of this center is higher than the sum of the other 2 averages  table 1   It is possible to suppose that if the other 2 centers had similar numbers of ETDs the first 4 rows could show similar results  The average number of partitions is the lowest for this center  but the rows are concerned with numbers of countries and are not related to the numbers of accesses  so it is expected that this fact does not impact the results     Rows 5 11 show percentages of accesses in the subsets  there are no computations relating data for different areas  CTC seems to be more international   the percentage of accesses from the international group is the highest  the percentage of accesses from the es pt group in the international group is the lowest and the same happens with other percentages related to accesses from pt speakers  This is interesting because there is a higher percentage of accesses from the international group and in this group es and pt are not as significant as in the other areas   The overall impression is that ETDs in Science   Technology behave differently from ones in Humanities and Social Sciences  In the case they are  more international   Accesses and How They Split Among Areas  This is a first attempt to examine data from this point of view   how accesses to ETDs are split among the 3 areas of knowledge  Most probably this examination is incomplete and more work should be devoted to it in the future  Table 1 shows that the number of ETDs and corresponding partitions are quite different in the 3 areas  In order to try to compare how each area  attracts  readers from all over the world  a normalization is used  An index of equivalence is proposed  It is   EI   1  Average Number of ETDs  x  Average of Averages Number of Partitions    2   There will be four different values for this index   one for the whole collection and one for each area of knowledge  They are computed for the 85 month time frame and the values are shown in table 4  If total numbers of accesses are multiplied by the corresponding index  the average number of accesses per ETD will be computed  This result is an average since there is no information concerning the individual files that were accessed  Another imperfection comes from restricted ETDs that have not be identified to be taken away from the computations  there is even a more difficult problem   ETDs that have been under restriction and afterwards became public  This last type of restriction is an option to students who want to protect their works while a patent is application is under exaimnation or an aritcle   book is waiting for publication for example   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011

behaviors can be determined  The percentage variations among rows in the same column of table 5 are the same as corresponding percentages shown in table 3  This is an exepcted result due to the definiton of EI given by  2   A comparison of the results of tables 5 and 3 yields a curious comment  In table 3  the analysis of percentages within an area of knowledge  Science   Technology is more international because its percentage of accesses from the international group was the highest  In table 5  where normalized data is shown  the average number of accesses  per ETD in Science   Technology  from the international group is the lowest among all  the same happens with accesses from the es pt and ptspeaking groups  and Portugal as well  The reason is that ETDs in this group have the lowest average of accesses per ETD among the 3 subsets  CONCLUSIONS  This is an initial analysis of accesses to ETDs in the 3 different areas of knowledge that PUC Rio offers graduate courses  No specific graduate programs were examined  each area is dealt with as a single unit to be compared to the whole collection  A quick overview of raw data indicated that in each are graduate programs behave differently in terms of accesses and this may be interesting to examine  Data generated during this work yielded a by product   the computation of the average numbers of partitions in each area  CTCH has the highest number and CTC the lowest  Although there are differences among areas  the general behavior of the collection and the behaviors of each area are similar concerning the importance of language in the accesses  Results indicate that language is an importante factor because    Percentages of accesses of the international group that came from the es pt group  table 3  are over 66  in all cases     Percentages of accesses of the international group that came from pt speaking countries  table 3  are over 51  in all cases     Percentages of accesses of the es pt speaking group that came from pt speaking countries  table 3  are over 77  in all cases   Within the language group  HDI is important because    Percentages of accesses of the international group that came from Portugal  table 3  are over 44  in all cases     Percentages of accesses of the es pt speaking group that came from Portugal  table 3  are over 67  in all cases     Percentages of accesses of the pt speaking group that came from Portugal  table 3  are over 85  in all cases   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Pavani  Examining Accesses by Country  Language and Areaof Knowledge  In the previous work  the authors tried to find collections with the same characteristics of PUC Rio s in order to compare accesses  but there were none that offered public access statistics with analogous functionality  If systems hosting ETDs offered a similar set of access statistics  comparisons would be possible  This could be a topic to be discussed by NDLTD   a suggestion of a set of statistics  production and accesses  for ETD systems  This would allow to compare behaviors by language  country
