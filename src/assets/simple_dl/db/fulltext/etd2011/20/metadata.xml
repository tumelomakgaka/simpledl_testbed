valuable aid to learning and scholarship  However  current systems that provide access to ETDs only provide a full text and or metadata based search and browse facility  thereby limiting ways in which users can interact with and make use of such collections  Long documents like ETDs can be viewed as containing various streams of information   textual content  in chapters  table of contents  etc    tables  images  references  etc  In addition to presenting the ETD as a whole to the user  we present the various streams of information in a synergistic fashion  in order to enhance browsing and comprehension  We describe a design and a prototype for an enhanced web based ETD browsing system  called ETD Enhance  It allows users to browse and interact with various streams of information present in ETDs  in an integrated fashion  To allow this  we have developed tools to extract individual chapters  figures  captions  etc  from these PDF files  For our pilot study  we have prototyped ETD Enhance on a small collection of ETDs  and have made the prototype available for public viewing and to collect feedback  We plan to research better techniques for extracting different information streams  as well as better support for user interaction  and to extend our work to the entire collection of ETDs  Keywords  Required  Electronic theses and dissertations  text extraction  browsing

VLTS  3  interfaces exist for users to be able to access this collection  Scirus allows keyword searches only  of metadata and or full text  VTLS allows keyword searches  in addition to faceted browsing  both using the metadata records  Figure 1   Utilization of this collection can be vastly increased by providing enhanced functionality and more usable access  This has been a goal of recent research at Virginia Tech s Digital Library Research Laboratory  As part of this initiative  in this paper we propose a design for a tool called ETD Enhance that is aimed at making reading and comprehension of ETDs easier  Accordingly  we extract various information streams   viz  text  images  references  etc  from ETDs  The various streams of information are presented to the users using a web demo to make the reading and comprehension of ETDs easier  In the rest of this section we give an outline of the various processes involved in the development of ETD Enhance  1 1 Extracting Information Streams from ETDs ETDs are generally submitted in  or converted eventually to  PDF format  So the first step in our process is to develop tools to extract various information streams that we are interested in  from PDF files  usually encoded according to the ISO standard  Extracting these streams of information can be quite challenging  Using a combination of several open source tools   Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Srinivasan et al   Enhanced browsing for ETDs  we have successfully developed a methodology to extract individual chapters  images  image captions  references  etc  1 2 Interactive Document Browsing As mentioned above  under the current system  users can either search the full text and or metadata  or browse by metadata  Many ETDs are presented as one single file for linear viewing  It can sometimes be challenging to read and comprehend a  100 page document when presented in such a fashion  In order to overcome these limitations  we have developed a web demonstration that presents various components of ETDs for viewing and user interaction   Figure 1  Scirus and VTLS ETD Search interfaces  2  RELATED WORK  2 1 Document Segmentation The document segmentation problem has received a fair amount of attention  4 5   The typical approach involves approximate string matching  e g   the text occurring in the table of contents of a document is matched against the text occurring in the body of the document in order to identify candidate chapter boundaries  These approaches  however  typically either have low accuracy and or are not generally applicable to other domains or data sets  The sources of error include incorrect identification of table of content entries  wrong mapping between physical and logical page numbers  etc  A major limitation of these approaches is that they do not make use of font related information  Font characteristics like size  case  location etc  can be quite valuable when segmenting the PDF documents  and sometimes can directly give away chapter boundaries  thereby increasing the accuracy of the method  Our proposed approach involves combining font related information along with semantic information occurring in the document  like possible chapter headings   Introduction    Summary   etc   occurring in ETDs  in order to segment ETDs  To the best of our knowledge  this is the first attempt at leveraging these disparate sources of information in order to implement document segmentation on ETDs   2 2 Interactive Document Browsing The journal Cell recently released a prototype for interactively viewing research papers  Figure 2   6   Instead of presenting the whole paper as a single file for linear viewing  various sections that typically occur in a research paper  like background work  summary  results  etc  are presented in separate tabs  This  and many other features like an image gallery  hyperlinked references  etc   provide special support for those working with research papers  This effort from Cell is one motivation for  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Srinivasan et al   Enhanced browsing for ETDs  the research presented in this paper   Figure 2  A Recent Prototype available at Cell s website  3  METHODS  We have used several open source tools in order to segment documents and extract images  Table 1   In the following sections  we discuss our methodology in detail  The various steps are shown in Figure 3   Tool  Source  Function  pdf2xml  7   SourceForge  Extracts font related metadata  pdfimages  XPDF  Linux   Extracts images  in PPM PBM format  from PDF files  pnmtojpeg  Linux utility  Converts PPM and PBM images into JPEG  Table 1  Open source software used  3 1 Extracting Chapters In order to extract text from ETDs  we used pdf2xml  It decodes the structure of PDF documents  and produces very finegrained font related information  metadata  about every token  word  that occurs in a PDF file  Sample metadata produced for an example token in a PDF file is shown in Figure 4  As can be seen  this output is not readily usable  Instead of producing lines or paragraphs that occur in PDF files as output  it generates tagged tokens  words   A page in a PDF file is treated as a co ordinate space  with the origin  0 0  being at the top left corner of the page  Every token is encoded as a point in XY space  relative to the origin  as seen in  x   y  in Figure 4    Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Srinivasan et al   Enhanced browsing for ETDs  Figure 3  Various steps in text and image extraction  In order to identify chapter boundaries  we first wrote parsers to decode the pdf2xml output and to identify Title Case  TC   Figure 4  XML metadata for the token  name  occurring in a PDF file  tokens  We define TC tokens as those tokens that are likely to be chapter titles  ETDs  though  commonly contain fonts with heterogeneous sizes and characteristics  Hence  identifying TC tokens is not straightforward  In order to do this  we detect candidate TC tokens that occur near the top of a page  and use these to identify chapter boundaries  Often  ETDs also have one or more words like  Introduction    Summary    Chapter    References   etc  in chapter headings  We use this cue also to identify TC tokens  3  2 Extracting Images and Captions In order to extract images from PDF files  we make use of pdfimages  which comes bundled in Linux  as part of the XPDF package  We process the PDF file page by page  and extract images that occur in each page  We are interested in extracting image captions also  Hence  once a page is found to contain image s   we extract the XML metadata information for the page using pdf2xml  Using this metadata information  we identify the XY location of the image s  on the page and identify small sized texts in the neighborhood of the images as possible image captions  The images extracted by pdfimages  however  occur in ppm  pnm  or vec formats  In order to convert them to JPEG  for ease of display on the web   we use pnmtojpeg  3 3 Extracting Other Miscellaneous Information As an add on  we also attempt to extract individual entries in the bibliography section and their corresponding references within the body of the ETD  We identified 3 major styles used in ETDs  Table 2   and wrote parsers to scan through the body of the ETD to identify locations of citations to references  Style  Example  Bracketed   Fox2011   Numeric   1   Parenthetical   Fox2011   Table 2  Major reference styles used in ETDs  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Srinivasan et al   Enhanced browsing for ETDs  3 4 Web Prototype Design We developed our web prototype using the content management system Drupal  8   We used several Drupal modules  like those for taxonomy  image gallery  etc   Table 4  in order to achieve the desired functionality  The users can browse by chapter  or pages   browse the figures  references  etc   see Section 4 1    Module Name  Function  Views  Image Gallery  Taxonomy  Taxonomy for browsing by chapter  Vocabulary  Creating navigation block for Taxonomy  Table 3  Drupal modules  4  RESULTS  4 1 Web Demo Our web demo allows for browsing by separate streams  chapters  images  etc    as well as presents a unified view of the entire document  The screenshots below  Figure 5  show the use of taxonomy and image gallery features  The web demo can be accessed at http   zappa dlib vt edu etd    4 2 Evaluation One critical issue in the development of such a system  besides its usability  is the performance of the backend methods  In order to understand how accurate our text  image  and caption extraction methods are  we ran several experiments  To evaluate the accuracy of the document segmentation technique  we randomly selected 10 ETDs each from the Engineering  Arts  Business  and Mathematics disciplines from the Virginia Tech ETD collection  Our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 70   50   70   and 60  respectively on this data set  We consider the algorithm to be accurate when it successfully identifies every single chapter boundary for an ETD   so for example in this case  our algorithm perfectly identified every single chapter boundary in 7 out of the 10 Engineering ETDs we had selected  If we relax the criterion a little bit  and allow for identification of some but not all chapters in ETDs  the accuracy goes higher  although more experiments are needed to get a good estimate  Nevertheless  out of 40 ETDs used in the experiment  our algorithm perfectly segmented 25 of them  Evaluating the performance of our image and captions extraction tool is a little harder  One problem is that pdfimages extracts certain extra ghost images from ETDs  These are just small sized spurious ppm or vec files  and without visual inspection  it is hard to tell whether it is a real image extracted from the ETD or just some ghost image  We observed  however  that in the case of ETDs in our collection  the ghost images are mostly  1KB in size  So  in order to perform a reasonable evaluation of our method  we ignore all extracted image files that are less than 1KB  Another problem is that pdfimages segments the images themselves under certain circumstances  For example  when the image is a flowchart  pdfimages extracts certain segments separately  and returns multiple images instead of the entire flowchart as a whole  To get a rough estimate of the performance of our image and caption extraction tool  we selected 10 ETDs at random from the Virginia Tech ETD collection  and extracted images  and captions  from them  These ETDs were found to contain a total of 91 images  out of which we were able to recover 36 images  The rest of the images either could not be recovered at all  or were recovered only partially or were segmented  Of these 36 images  we were able to extract captions for 24 of them  More experimentation  including user studies  is needed to get better estimates

demo  5  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper we present the design and a prototype of an enhanced document browsing system for ETDs  Using open source software  we developed tools to extract individual chapters  images  and other auxiliary information like individual references  image captions  etc  While our tools achieve good performance in general  under certain circumstances they do not  In order to improve on this  we are looking at using commercial PDF manipulation software  TET in particular  which is known to have good performance especially with image extraction  One other important area of future research is to perform user studies on the web demo in order to better understand the effects on typical users of ETDs  REFERENCES  1  Networked Digital Library of Theses and
