in the final References section  but sometimes as footnotes or end of chapter references  One objective is to extend ETD MS so that references can be included in the metadata  Another objective is to have automatic methods to extract these references from ETDs  A third objective is to manage the references inside ETD db  providing browse  search  and presentation services  We first extract the reference section  or other portions with references  from an ETD  store the references into the metadata database for ETDs  and show the reference information in the reference tab of the ETD  splash  page  pulling the reference information from the metadata database  Since reference sections can be located at each chapter  or as footnotes  as well as at the end of theses  new methods for intelligent and reliable reference extraction are being devised  These make use of machine learning  heuristics  knowledge bases  and text processing techniques  As a result of this project  software and scripts for reference section extraction will be available  Metadata records with reference information included in the metadata are generated  and represented according to the extended version of ETD MS  Those in the scholarly community who use ETDs could have an easier time accessing and giving credit to prior research publications  Keywords  ETD MS  Reference section extraction  machine learning INTRODUCTION  A thesis or dissertation is one of the scholarly works that shows a partial fulfillment of requirements of a degree that a student pursues in higher education  Virginia Tech has been a leader in electronic thesis and dissertation  ETD  initiatives since 1987  As a result of collecting finished theses and dissertations from graduate students and doctoral candidates  the collection has grown to exceed 18 000 manuscripts 1  ETDs are described  managed  published  and searched using several types of metadata  e g   descriptive metadata  including bibliographic information   administrative metadata  technical metadata  etc  To facilitate our research on extending use of the ETD database  the reference sections of manuscripts need to be extracted and included as part of the browsing page for each ETD  Extraction by hand would require countless hours of work  so automation is required  In scholarly works  e g   journal articles  conference papers  and technical reports    reference  may refer to a section of document specifying resources referred in the text  A  References  section is included in the ETDs for description of relations in the text between other scholarly works  Regarding presenting such data and relations  we were inspired by the ACM Digital Library  DL   Figure 1 shows the VT ETD  splash  page vs  the ACM Digital Library  reference tab   The former has no references as metadata  while the ACM DL enables users to browse references  There can be three types of reference in the text  references at the end of the document  chapter references  and footnotes  References should be extracted by some reference extraction techniques  e g   regular expression  rule based approach  or machine learning approach  to parse and analyze them  Reference section extraction can be considered as an information extraction or document segmentation problem  To solve this problem  classification techniques  commonly used in pattern recognition and data mining  can be exploited  Typically  brute force techniques using regular expressions have been found to be inadequate for this task because of the various different types of references that can be found in a thesis or dissertation  Therefore  we adopt machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of reference extraction over naive methods  The technique we have created is able to robustly extract reference sections from ETDs  1  ETD collection  Browse Available ETDs by Author  http   scholar lib vt edu theses browse by author index html

previous work on metadata schema for references  and information extraction from documents  Reference section extraction  General information extraction  IE  techniques from documents have been widely researched  Naomi Sager directed an early IE system in the Linguistic String Project  focused on the medical domain  Sager  1981   The Message Understanding Conference  MUC   sponsored by the U S  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   encouraged IE research from 1987 to 1998  Grishman   Sundheim  1996   At MUC 7  there was evaluation of extraction of useful information from news messages about Airplane crashes and Rocket Missile Launches  MUC encouraged a focus on extracting four elements  named entities  co references  template elements  and template relations  Subsequently  the Automatic Content Extraction  ACE  evaluation project was organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  from 2000 to 2008  An aim of the ACE program was development of technologies that extract entities from language data and then infer relations among them  Those two programs  MUC and ACE  contributed to the development of a variety of indicators for deep evaluation  Regarding metadata extraction  Han et al  proposed automatic document metadata extraction using support vector machines  a machine learning technique   In addition  Parscit is an open source package which enables users to extract reference strings from a document and then parse them  It is currently being used in CiteSeerX  a citation oriented digital library for computing  It is based on some heuristics  e g   using regular expressions like    R r  eferences    or    B b  ibliography     Reference Metadata Schema  Recently  some efforts have been made to provide metadata schema for scholarly works  e g   journal articles  conference papers  technical reports  including ETDs  Hence  we review  1  Dublin Core  DC  Metadata Element Set  2  Qualified DC Terms  3  MODS  4

System with References  General Metadata Schema  Dublin Core Metadata Element Set 2  The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary for describing an arbitrary digital object  It is often called  Simple DC  and consists of fifteen primitive properties  Dublin Core is a practical and popular metadata schema which most repositories are adopting  In Simple DC  the dc relation property can be used to describe references  Qualified DC Terms 3  Qualified DC terms include a variety of properties describing bibliographic information  In contrast to simple DC  these terms are in the  terms  namespace  There are two terms related to references  dcterms references and dcterms  isReferencedBy  The former describes a related resource  literally   References   that is referred to by the described resource  whereas the latter describes a related resource  citations  that references the described resource  Metadata Object Description Schema  MODS   MODS is a metadata standard for describing an arbitrary object  adopted by Library of Congress  It consists of twenty top level elements  relatedItem can be used for describing a reference  For more details  see the official web site 4  Metadata Schema Dedicated to ETDs  ETD MS  Metadata Standard   ETD MS is a standardized metadata schema for interoperability  dedicated to describing ETDs  Most of the properties in ETD MS are found in the Dublin Core Element Sets  TDL MODS  The Texas Digital Library  TDL  developed another metadata schema for describing ETDs  TDL MODS is adopting MODS  EXTENSION OF ETD MS TO INCLUDE REFERENCE INFORMATION  To extend ETD MS to include reference information  we considered existing solutions  As shown in Table 1  Simple DC  DC Terms  and MODS provide elements for describing references  We use dc relation and dcterms references for our study  In addition  Guidelines for Encoding Bibliographic Citation Information in Dublin Core  Apps  2005  describe helpful

and RDF  HTML XHTML  DC Metadata Initiative provides some guidelines for expressing DC metadata with  X HTML  Johnston   Powell  2008   When metadata for references is implemented in  X HTML  it can be represented using link and meta tags  The former has either URL or references relative to a base URI as an attribute  the latter has the content of metadata as an attribute  An example showing how the reference metadata is implemented with HTML is described in Table 2  They have either a human readable  e g   a plain text  or a machine readable form  e g   OpenURL ContextObject  OCLC  2009    XML  DC metadata can be implemented with XML  In contrast to  X HTML  XML representation expresses reference metadata using the value of metadata property elements tags  The Guideline for Dublin Core Implementation with XML  Powell  2003  provides some recommendations regarding implementing with XML  An example implemented with XML is compared to that of HTML in Table 2  This XML representation including metadata for references can be used in OAI PMH  a protocol for interoperable metadata harvesting  to harvest provide metadata for  references  from for other system  RDF  DC metadata also can be implemented with RDF  The Guideline for Dublin Core Implementation with RDF  Nilsson  Powell  Johnston    Naeve  2008  describes how constructs and vocabularies used in DC metadata are organized and expressed with DC Abstract Model  DCAM   Powell  Nilsson  Naeve  Johnston    Baker  2007   a RDF conceptual model  which builds on RDF undertaken by W3C  DCAM  in turn  defines the nature of component used and expresses how for the components to be combined to create information structures  Examples of the RDF representation are an application profile  2  Dublin Core Metadata

Automatic reference section extraction is a module of the ETD db system for exposing references to the public  Figure 2 illustrates its system architecture  The automatic reference section extraction consists of the following  pdf2txt  feature extraction  learning  training   and reference section extraction  see Figure 3    Figure 2  System Architecture  Figure 3  Dataflow Diagram of reference section extraction  PDF2Txt  The Apache PDFBox API is an open source  Java based library that supplies components for working on and manipulating PDF files  In the context of our project  the operations required dealing with stripping content from a PDF document and writing it to a text file  The version used in this project was 1 4 0  Feature Extraction  Features that we use can be categorized into three types  Word local features  line features  and contextual features  Table 5 describes each feature with simple examples  28 different string patterns  e g   types of punctuation  capitalization  etc   are used as word features  The token vector is given a bit string for each pattern it does or does not have  e g   0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0       0 0 1 0   Each feature vector is based on a line of text with a token vector for the tokens it has and a null vector for all of the tokens it lacks  For training data  each line is labeled as  REF  if it is a reference  as  NON REF  otherwise  Feature Name  Descriptions  Examples  Word local features  28 different string patterns  Types of punctuation  capitalization  etc   Line feature  Patterns in a line  Number of word in the line  percentage of capitalized words  Contextual feature  Patterns of a neighborhood  Class   REF  or  NON REF   of neighbor lines before and after the current line Table 5  Feature sets  Training  After extracting features  a machine learning based classifier is trained to determine reference sections from texts  It is important to create training sets for WEKA  Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis   First  some lines from a reference section and from the body of the text are extracted to a separate file  For training  features also should to be extracted  The feature vectors are then created to measure the similarity between each line on the vector space  In particular  there exists a class tag  i e    REF  or  NON REF   indicating if that line is a reference or not  as an attribute of each vector  Reference section extraction  Classification   In this way  the program can  learn  over time various patterns that references follow  Once a classifier object is trained  any feature vector can be tested against previous classifications to see if it  matches  any previous patterns  To implement this  WEKA  open source machine learning software  is used to deal specifically with data mining operations  The operations provided by WEKA are crucial to the machine learning techniques employed by our software  The version used in this project was 3 7 3  Figure 4

We evaluated our machine learning approach to reference section extraction  We used six documents randomly selected from the VT ETD db system  and marked their reference sections and non reference sections  manually  Table 6 shows the statistics of documents used in this evaluation  Incidentally  all reference sections were found at the end of documents  Items   of lines   of reference lines

informally did experiments on chapter reference section extraction through picking some documents with chapter references  ParsCit failed saying  Citation text cannot be found  ignoring   The ETD selected used  Literature Cited  as the reference section header in each chapter  ParsCit does probably not include  Literature Cited  as a starting word of a reference section  Even though we did an experiment with chapter reference sections starting with  References   ParsCit extracted only the references in the last chapter  it also had some extraction errors which failed to find the end of reference section  When we did an experiment considering contextual features  against document 6  which showed the worst performance   the performance was improved  resulting in  precision  0 973  recall  0 986  F1  0 979  DISCUSSION  One of the problems that we encountered was in creating feature vectors  We wanted to include both patterns in each token  and the tokens themselves  to help identify which lines were references  Initially we created a string with a 0 or 1 for all of the 28 patterns  separated by commas   for each token  The feature vector would be a combination of the pattern strings for each token it had  and null pattern strings  all zeros  for all of the tokens it did not have  This process created incredibly large  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Park   Fox  Enriching the VT ETD db System with References   CSV files  The long feature vectors would take up too much memory and crash the Java virtual machine  To solve the problem with incorrect formatting  we had to go into our reference extraction program and generate a file in a format compatible to WEKA  an  arff file  which requires attribute cells  e g     attribute A CAPS  0 1    where  A  is a word   CAPS  is a pattern  before feature vectors  e g   1 0 0 0 0 1       to place  This is an extremely long and time consuming step  as an attribute cell must be added for every pattern  e g   CAPS  NUMERIC  ONLYLETTERS  times the number of words  e g    A    Abraham        in the dictionary  i e    attribute A CAPS  0 1    attibute A NUMERIC  0 1        attribute A LETTER SONLY  0 1    attribute Abraham CAPS  0 1   and so on   To solve the problem of incredibly long feature vectors  we reduced the size of the string created for each token  We treated each of the zeros and ones in the pattern string as a bit in an integer  This reduced the pattern string to a single number  This procedure is also to keep each string pattern combination unique  In the end  these integer values have been transformed into bit strings by a filter NumericToBinary in the WEKA tool  CONCLUSION   FUTURE WORK  In this paper  our main contributions are to enable users to easily access reference information without opening the digital content file  usually  stored in PDF format  Moreover  integrating the automatic reference metadata  the digital library will be able to provide bibliographical information in a specific way  i e   COinS  Context Object in Span  corresponding to each ETD and its references for a crawler  e g   Zotero  a Firefox plug in  with more plentiful metadata  ETD MS   Especially  we focused on references bibliography information in a pilot project carried out by a group in a Virginia Tech Computer Science course  CS4624   We stored a new reference metadata item into an ETD metadata DB  in which the current ETD db system does not provide reference metadata  Machine learning techniques not only show great potential for reference extraction  but also can be applied to extracting specific data from references  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  We thank Kenneth Lee  Sean Springa  and Adam Larson  senior students of the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech  for conducting a class project in the Spring 2011 CS4624 course  We also give thanks to Collin Brittle and Kimberli Weeks  members of the staff of the Digital Library and Archive Department at Virginia Tech  for constructive comments on metadata schema implementation for references
