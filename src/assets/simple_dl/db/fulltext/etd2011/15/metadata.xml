the Arab Gulf States  Semi structured interviews were conducted with representatives of five groups of stakeholders with an interest in the implementation of ETD programmes from five Gulf States universities  Research participants identified a number of social issues that influenced the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  These issues included the influence of other people  such as the influence of peers  the influence of academic supervisors on students  attitudes  the influence of promotional and advocacy activities on a university community and the influence of seeing other universities already adopting ETD programmes  In general  the research participants perceived the importance of social factors  especially promotional activities  in influencing the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  Keywords  Social influence  Promotional activities  peers  influence  supervisors  influence  ETD programmes  Arab Gulf States  INTRODUCTION  Electronic theses and dissertations  ETD  can be defined as theses and dissertations by masters and doctoral students that are digitized  submitted  archived and are accessible in electronic formats  Allard  2003  Goldsmith  2002  Park  et al   2007   There are two standard types of ETD  The first one is born digital  that is  a student created digital document converted to the suitable submission format  usually PDF  and made available online with related metadata  The second type is an electronic document created by the university scanning a student s printed thesis or dissertation  Allard  2003  Fineman  2003  Fox  2001  Goldsmith  2002   ETD initiatives emerged in the 1980s after the development of electronic publishing on the Internet and the technological platforms and software that support it  Reeves  et al   2006   The idea of ETD submission was first mentioned in 1987 by Universal Microfilms Inc  UMI  in the United States  Twenty years later  many institutions have joined this initiative  now called the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   NDLTD now has more than 233 members from all over the world  Reeves  et al   2006   These include institutional  consortial and individual members  Several interrelated factors have been found to influence the adoption and development of ETD programmes in university libraries  These include the perceived benefits of ETD programmes  the availability of the required resources  technological  cultural  and social factors  This paper discusses the perceived social factors that influence the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  Objective  This paper is part of a larger research project that examines the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  In particular  the research aims to explore the enablers and barriers influencing the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  To date  no qualitative or quantitative research has been undertaken in the Gulf States to  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Alsalmi  et al   Social factors influencing the adoption of ETD programmes  explore the enablers and barriers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes  The findings of this research will help academic institutions plan for the future and make informed investment decisions in adopting ETD programmes  This paper focuses on the social issues that have been found to influence the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Arab Gulf States  Research Method  The full research project used both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies  This paper presents the findings of the first qualitative phase  Semi structured interviews were conducted with forty five key informants  postgraduate students  academic staff  library managers  system administrators  and postgraduate officers  in the Gulf States  The research was conducted in five universities  Sultan Qaboos University  Oman   United Arab Emirates University  Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University  Saudi Arabia   University of Bahrain  and Kuwait University  This research employed a technique called constant comparative analysis to analyse the gathered qualitative data  This approach offered a sound framework for working with a large amount of descriptive data  According to Pickard  2007   this technique involves taking one piece of data and judging it with all others that may be related or diverse in order to develop conceptualisations of the potential relations between pieces of data  THE FINDINGS  SOCIAL INFLUENCE   Venkatesh  et al    2003  in their Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology  UTAUT  found that social Influence is one of the direct determinants of behavioral intentions  They defined this determinant as the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new innovation  For this research  this factor was interpreted to mean how others influence the attitudes of the different parties involved in ETD programmes  A literature review showed that there were some cases where academic staff advised their students to make some access restrictions to their theses  McMillan  2005   This shows that postgraduate students  decisions are  sometimes  influenced by their research supervisors  Moreover  Greig  2005  claimed that the absence of a person responsible for promoting the ETD programme in the university community was a barrier to the adoption and implementation of an ETD programme at the University of Glasgow  Interviewees of this study perceived several social issues as influencing the adoption of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  Analysis of the interview findings showed some variation in opinions in terms of social influence  On one hand  around two thirds of the research participants indicated that their attitudes toward ETD programmes would not be influenced by other people s opinions  On the other hand  the majority of the research participants highlighted that conducting promotional activities would have a great influence on people s opinions toward the adoption of ETD programmes  The following subsections analyse and discuss several issues that were categorised under social influence  These issues include the influence of other people on the research participants  the influence of academic supervisors on students  attitudes  the influence of promotional and advocacy activities on a university community  the influence of seeing other universities already adopting ETD programmes  and concerns about the perceived quality of theses and dissertations  Peers  Influence  Perceptions gathered from the research participants showed that the attitudes of the majority of the research participants would not be influenced by others  opinions  They explained that they were already very convinced by the importance of ETD programmes and  thus  they were unlikely to change their attitudes  Some of them further claimed that they were able to change others  opinions about these programmes  However  a minority of participants expressed a possibility of changing their attitudes toward ETD programmes  They indicated that ETD programmes are a new idea and they have a lack of knowledge about it  As stated earlier  the majority of the research participants indicated that they were very convinced by the idea of making theses and dissertations electronically available and  thus  were unlikely to change their attitudes toward ETD programmes  In this regard  an academic staff member reported that  I will never change my attitude because I am very convinced by the importance of this programme   A postgraduate student also stated that  I personally convinced that making theses and dissertations electronically available in the internet is very beneficial  Therefore  I will not change my attitude   Some of the research participants not only indicated that they would not change their attitudes toward ETD programmes  they also expressed that they were in a position where they were able to convince other people about these programmes  A member of academic staff stated that  I have reached a stage where I can help to convince other people about this programme   A postgraduate officer  in addition  stated  I do not think anyone can influence my positive personal opinion about the idea of making theses electronically available  In contrast  I think I can influence others by convincing them of the importance of this project    Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Alsalmi  et al   Social factors influencing the adoption of ETD programmes  A few of the research participants on the other hand  expressed a possibility of changing their attitudes toward ETD programmes based on others  opinions and recommendations  Some of them explained that they have a lack of knowledge about ETD programmes at the current time  They also expressed that they will change their attitudes if others provided compelling evidence to the contrary  An academic stated that  if there are serious problems that I do not see at this moment  maybe I will have to change my thinking   Another postgraduate officer also expressed that  if others have compelling evidence to the contrary  yes  I might change my mind   Research Supervisors  Influence on Students  Attitudes  The literature reviewed showed incidents where some academic advisors advised their students to restrict access to their theses and dissertations  McMillan  2005   This example indicates that academic advisors can play a significant role in encouraging or discouraging their students to participate in ETD programmes  The research interviews focused on the relationship between academic supervisors and their postgraduate students in terms of participation in ETD programmes  Academic supervisors were asked whether or not they were going to advise their students to participate in ETD programmes  Postgraduate students were also asked if their attitudes toward ETD programmes would be influenced by their supervisors  Perceptions gathered from academic staff showed that the majority of them were going to advise their students to participate in ETD programmes  With regard to students  perceptions  the majority of them indicated that their attitude would not be influenced by their supervisors  advice  Nevertheless  a few of them explained that they might change their attitudes because they believe that their supervisors have better experience and knowledge about these programmes  Almost all of the academic supervisors indicated that they were going to advise their postgraduate students to participate in ETD programmes and make their theses electronically available  These perceptions reflect supervisors  appreciation of the benefits of these programmes  An academic staff member reported that  I will encourage my students to participate in this programme   Another academic stated that  for sure I will advice them to participate because of the benefits of these programmes   On the other hand  only one academic staff member indicated that he might advise his students to make some sort of access restriction to their thesis if there were lack in the appropriate copyright policies  In this regard  he explained  I will advise my students to participate but with some kind of access restrictions  I will not advise them to agree to make their theses electronically available before I make sure that their copyright is protected   Analysis of postgraduate students  perceptions shows that the attitudes of the majority of them would not be influenced by their supervisors because they were convinced by the importance of ETD programmes  Even though they indicated that they would listen to the points of view of their supervisors  they expected that they would retain on their positive attitudes toward ETD programmes  One postgraduate student stated that  I will listen to my supervisor s point of view and at the end I will follow my opinion because I am very convinced that this programme is very beneficial and important   Several students further expressed that their supervisors had no role or authority over their decision to participate in ETD programmes  They also thought that the copyright of the theses belonged to students only and supervisors had no authority over theses  In this regard  a student stated  because the thesis is my work and my supervisor was only giving me advice  the copyright belongs to me and the researchers  supervisors have no relation to the thesis  copyright   In addition to these opinions  other students expressed self confidence about their attitudes toward ETD programmes and indicated that they might be able to change the attitude of their supervisors toward ETD programmes  In this regard  one postgraduate student claimed that  I do not think my supervisor will change my opinion about this programme  In contrast  I will try to convince him of my point of view   On the other hand  there were a few postgraduate students who indicated that they might change their attitudes based on their supervisors  opinions and advice  especially if they provided evidence and their arguments were convincing  One postgraduate student reported that  If my supervisor provided evidence of what he she is claiming  then I would change my opinion   Promotional and Advocacy Activities Influence  From the literature reviewed  promotional activities have been found to be an enabler for adopting ETD programmes  Asner and Polani  2008   According to Greig  2005   the presence within the senior management of the university of a person responsible for informing and discussing the legal issues of concern to postgraduate students and academic staff can make a big difference and have a significant impact on students  participation in ETD programmes  On the other hand  he stated that the absence of such a person was a barrier to the adoption and implementation of an ETD programme at the University of Glasgow  Greig  2005   Like the literature findings  the interviews also showed that the research participants gave emphasis to promotional activities in successful adoption of ETD programmes  The majority of the participants perceived that conducting appropriate promotional and advocacy activities would help to attract people to ETD programmes by making people obtain awareness  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Alsalmi  et al   Social factors influencing the adoption of ETD programmes  about ETD programmes and their importance and benefits  In addition to this  several participants  postgraduate students and academic staff in particular  suggested that promotional activities should give people assurance that copyright is protected and preserved  Such awareness  as a result  would encourage the university community to appreciate and support the adoption of these programmes  On the other hand  a minority of participants highlighted that promotional activities were not undertaken properly at their universities  The following sub sections outline the influence of promotional and advocacy activities  From the interviews conducted  the research participants suggested that promotional activities should inform people about ETD programmes and their importance and benefits  They thought that once people obtained awareness about ETD programmes and their benefits  they would be more willing to support and participate in these programmes  A library manager outlined this idea and stated that  I think the existence of promotional activities will have a positive influence on the adoption of this programme  Such activities will make students and academic staff gain awareness about the benefits of this programme and its importance   In addition  a few participants indicated that promotional activities would help to bring more administrative support to these programmes  They explained that by making people at a higher level obtain awareness about these programmes and their benefits  administrators would be more willing to support the adoption of these programmes  In this regard  one postgraduate officer reported that  making people obtain awareness about the importance and benefits of ETD programmes will give the project wide support from administrators and other related people   One library manager also reported that  The appreciation of this programme at the administration level is the main enabler to the adoption of ETD programmes  The person who has the power to take a decision should appreciate the importance of this project  If this person is convinced and appreciates the importance of this project  he she will provide and offer all the financial support  hardware and software  and establish all the required policies and legislations  In addition  the majority of academic staff and postgraduate students indicated that promotional activities should cover the copyright issues and clarify how theses are protected and preserved  They also observed that once people are confident that the copyright issues are managed appropriately this would encourage them to support and participate in these programmes  In this regard  one student expressed that  promotional activities will give me more confidence about this programme  especially if I know that there will be protection to my copyright by the university   An academic staff member suggested that  promotional activities should convince people about ETD programmes and assure them that copyright is protected and preserved   Nevertheless  a few participants expressed concern about promotional activities at their universities  They indicated that such activities are either limited or not available at all  An academic staff member expressed that  I did not hear about any promotional or advocacy activity about these issues   Such a lack in conducting appropriate promotional activities would have a negative influence in encouraging more people to support the adoption of ETD programmes  Additionally  the absence of promotional activities would result in a lack in the awareness and appreciation of the importance of ETD programmes  especially at the administration level  An academic staff member stated that  the lack of awareness by the university administrators about the importance of this project is the main barrier to the adoption of these programmes   Going back to the literature reviewed  Greig  2005  claimed that the absence of a person responsible for promoting the ETD programme in the university community was a barrier to the adoption and implementation of an ETD programme at the University of Glasgow  Thus  based on the literature findings and a few participants  perceptions  it can be concluded that the lack in conducting appropriate promotional activities would be considered as one of the main barriers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  Influence of Other Universities  From the interviews conducted  library managers and postgraduate officers indicated that seeing other universities already adopting ETD programmes would motivate and encourage them to adopt these programmes  They explained that seeing other universities adopting ETD programmes would give them the opportunity to benefit from their experience  In particular  they would be able to benefit from their experience in how they had dealt with legal issues  such as copyright and plagiarism issues  As a result  participants thought that benefiting from others  experience would save much time and effort for their institutions  In this regard  one library manager stated that  for sure  such institutions have already gone through all of the adoption procedures and faced several challenges and got enough experience  Certainly  if such institutions gave us their experience  this will save much time and effort   Perceived Quality of Theses and Dissertations  A few academic staff and postgraduate students mentioned that concerns about the quality of theses and dissertations are one  Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Alsalmi  et al   Social factors influencing the adoption of ETD programmes  of the reasons for people rejecting ETD programmes  They explained that some students may refuse to participate in these programmes if their theses are not in a good condition in terms of following the scientific and appropriate way of conducting and writing research  They would be afraid if they allowed online access to their theses that other people would read their theses and criticize them  They also indicated that the university may not accept making theses and dissertations electronically available if they are not in a good quality  In this regard  an academic staff member stated that  One of the reasons that hinder the adoption of this project in some universities or in some specializations is that theses and dissertations are not of a good standard and do not reach the level that allows them to be published and made available electronically in the internet  Therefore  these institutions try to be careful when putting theses online and  therefore  do not put substandard theses because theses represent the university quality and the quality of its scientific research  Based on these perceptions  the quality of theses and dissertations would be considered as one of the barriers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  DISCUSSIONS OF THE FINDINGS  As in the literature review  the research participants perceived the importance of social factors  especially promotional activities  in influencing the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  However  with regard to others  influence on the research participants  attitudes  the majority of them indicated that they would not be influenced by others  opinions  They explained that they were very convinced by the importance and benefits of ETD programmes  Thus  they were unlikely to change their attitudes toward these programmes  This finding highlights the influence of the appreciation of the benefits in others  influence on the research participants  attitudes toward ETD programmes  On the other hand  only a few participants indicated that they might change their attitudes  Members of this group explained that they had a lack of knowledge about ETD programmes  This finding highlights the importance of conducting promotional activities in order to make people gain awareness about ETD programmes  With regard to the influence of academic advisors over their students  the majority of the interviewed academics expressed appreciation of ETD programmes and  thus  they were going to advise their students to participate in ETD programmes and make their theses available electronically  This gives an indication that the influence of academic advisors will be positive and  thus  can be considered as an enabler to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  On the other hand the majority of postgraduate students expressed that their attitudes toward ETD programmes would not be influenced by their supervisors  especially if it is a negative influence  Students explained that they were also convinced of the importance of ETD programmes  This finding again highlights the influence of the appreciation of the benefits in students  attitudes toward ETD programmes  These perceptions give an indication that students had strong motivation and were willing to participate in ETD programmes  This  as a result  can be considered as one of the enablers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  With regard to promotional activities  the research participants highlighted the importance of conducting appropriate promotional activities  They explained that promotional activities would help to make people gain awareness about ETD programmes and their benefits to them  Additionally  promotional activities would help to make clear how theses  copyright is protected  They further thought that once people were aware of ETD programmes and their benefits  they would be motivated and more willing to support the adoption of ETD programmes  Several participants  in addition  assumed that making people at the top level of management obtain awareness about these programmes and their benefits would help to bring more administrative support to these programmes  These findings  as a result  highlight the importance of conducting promotional activities in order to adopt ETD programmes successfully  They also highlight the influence of the availability of appropriate promotional activities in the appreciation of the benefits of ETD programmes  However  a few participants reported that there was a lack of appropriate promotional activities at their institutions  This is because either some of the universities investigated had not yet adopted an ETD programme or had just started the first steps in adopting ETD programmes  Nevertheless  such a lack of promotional activities would have a negative influence in obtaining motivation and support from the university community  The research participants explained that some people may have a lack of knowledge about ETD programmes and the related legal issues  Thus  they might not appreciate the importance of adopting such programmes  In particular  people in the university administration would not support the adoption of these programmes if they were not convinced of the importance of these programmes  Thus  the absence of appropriate promotional activities would be considered as a barrier to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  We have seen earlier that the absence of a person responsible for promoting the ETD programme in the university community was a barrier to the adoption and implementation of an ETD programme at the University of Glasgow  Greig  2005    Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Cape Town  South Africa  13 17 September 2011   Alsalmi  et al   Social factors influencing the adoption of ETD programmes  With regard to the influence of seeing other universities adopting ETD programmes  the interviewees indicated that this would give them more motivation and willingness to adopt the same programmes  They explained that they would be able to benefit from other universities  experience in adopting ETD programmes  In that  they would be able to examine the steps other universities went through in order to adopt these programmes and see how they dealt with legal issues  such as copyright and plagiarism  Thus  the adoption of ETD programmes in other universities is considered as enabler to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  Another social issue reported by a few participants is the perceived quality of theses and dissertations  They explained that some people  especially postgraduate students  would be hesitant or may refuse to participate in ETD programmes because their theses were not of a good quality  They would be afraid if they allowed online access to their theses that other people would read their theses and criticize them  Thus  the quality of theses and dissertations would be one of the barriers that confront some people from participating in ETD programmes  CONCLUSION  In conclusion  the research participants highlighted the importance of social factors in influencing the adoption and development of ETD programmes  In that  they understood that conducting appropriate promotional activities would have a positive influence on the adoption and development of these programmes  For example  promotional activities reported would help to make people gain awareness about ETD programmes and their benefits  Additionally  promotional activities would help to make clear how theses  copyright is protected  As a result of such activities  people would be motivated and more willing to support the adoption of ETD programmes and also would help to bring more administrative support to these programmes  However  a few participants indicated that there was a lack of conducting appropriate promotional activities at their institutions  Thus  the absence of appropriate promotional activities was considered as one of the barriers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  We have seen in the literature reviewed that the absence of a person responsible for promoting the ETD programme in the university community was a barrier to the adoption and implementation of an ETD programme at the University of Glasgow  Greig  2005   Additionally  the research participants highlighted the benefit of seeing other universities already adopting ETD programmes  They considered the ability to learn from others  experience as an enabler to the adoption and development of these programmes  They indicated that this would give them more motivation and willingness to adopt the same programmes  With regard to others  influence on the research participants  the majority indicated that others would not be able to change their attitudes toward ETD programmes  This reflected strong motivation and appreciation of the benefits of ETD programmes  Additionally  we have seen that many academic advisors are going to advise their students to participate in ETD programmes and make their theses available electronically  Thus  this also can be considered as an enabler to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States  In general  social factors can be categorised as one of the enablers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes  The only exception is the lack of appropriate promotional activities at the investigated institutions  Additionally  concerns about the quality of theses may make students and universities more reluctant to make such theses electronically available  Poor quality of theses may cause some people  especially students  to hesitate from making them available publically in the internet  A few students suggest that making their theses electronically available would make them more accessible and  thus  people may criticise their work  These issues can be barriers to the adoption and development of ETD programmes in the Gulf States and further research that address them will be important  REFERENCES  1   Allard  S  L  2003  Innovation in a university social system  the adoption of electronic theses and dissertations
