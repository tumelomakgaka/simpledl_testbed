An Overview of Theses Canada and ETD Initiatives at Library and Archives Canada Sharon Reeves Theses Canada  Library and Archives Canada sharon reeves lac bac gc ca ABSTRACT A centrally coordinated program for theses was established at the National Library of Canada  NLC  now part of Library and Archives Canada  in 1965  In the intervening years the program has undergone many changes  The advent of electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  in the 1990s and the  Contentville  controversy in 2000 led the NLC to hold a national consultation with its university stakeholders to determine the direction of the national theses program with respect to electronic theses  The consultation presented the opportunity to re examine Canada s national theses program  its goals and how best to achieve them  One outcome of the consultation was the establishment of the Canadian Theses Service Advisory Committee with a mandate to focus on the transition from print to electronic theses both at NLC and at Canadian universities  Based on consultation with the Committee Theses Canada has undertaken to develop a national electronic theses program based on the principle of open access  This paper gives an overview of the history of the Theses Canada program and discusses various initiatives Library and Archives Canada  LAC  has undertaken to facilitate the development of its ETD program  such as the development of the Theses Canada Portal and LAC s program to harvest metadata and ETDs from universities  Keywords  Theses Canada Portal  Canadian ETD initiatives  1  HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL THESIS PROGRAM IN CANADA The centrally coordinated national theses program at Library and Archives Canada  LAC  was established in 1965 at the National Library of Canada  NLC  at the request of various deans of Canadian graduate schools  The program had two objectives    to facilitate access to theses by identifying what was available and by providing copies via ILL or sale  and    to preserve theses by microfilming paper copies and storing preservation masters according to archival standards  For thirty seven years the program continued to fulfill its mandate in much the same way  The only significant changes to program delivery came first in 1990 when NLC outsourced the reproduction and sales aspects of the program and then in 1998 when  under the terms of a new contract  UMI Dissertations Publishing  UMI  began to digitize the theses as well as reproducing them on microfiche  Since the program began theses authors have signed a non exclusive license with NLC  which initially allowed it to reproduce their theses on microfilm and which was revised in the early 1990s to allow for the distribution of theses in electronic format on the Internet  The license clearly indicates that authors maintain copyright ownership    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7

Service s  CTS  initial partners  Over the past forty one years participation in the program has steadily grown to the point where Theses Canada currently has partnerships with sixty universities  One of the unique aspects of the program is that there is no written agreement between each university and Theses Canada  The only criteria for joining the program is that a university must belong to the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada  This makes for a flexible situation for universities  allowing them to stop participating in the program at any time  It also leaves Theses Canada free to develop its program for its university partners as a whole  after undertaking any necessary consultations   3  NATIONAL CONSULTATION ON ETDS IN CANADA During the late 1990s interest in electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  started to percolate at various Canadian universities in response to the initiatives concerning ETDs that were taking place in the United States and elsewhere  It was natural for the Canadian academic community to look to the National Library of Canada for leadership in those early days of transition from print theses  However an event that took place in the summer of 2000  which has since become known as the  Contentville  controversy  really kick started the national discussion  In the summer of 2000 North American theses authors started to find citations for their theses on a new American website called Contentville  The website made it appear that theses could be purchased from Contentville although in reality any requests for purchases were relayed to ProQuest Information and Learning UMI Dissertations Publishing  which had agreed to provide the citations to Contentville for the purpose of resource discovery  The Canadian media picked up the story and the Canadian Theses Service received many complaints  largely with respect to the sale of theses  from both theses authors and members of the Canadian academic community  The outcome was that citations for Canadian theses were removed from the Contentville website in September 2000  Shortly after that the website disappeared  As a result of this crisis NLC organized a national consultation on e theses  which took place December 4  2000  Seventy eight participants from across Canada took part in the consultation  Represented were deans of graduate schools  university administrators and professors  library professionals and students  as well as participants from various organizations associated with academia  The primary objective of the consultation was to discuss the national theses program in an electronic environment  The other issue that was discussed at the consultation was that of sales of Canadian theses by NLC s contractor  UMI Dissertations Publishing  In fact many Canadian theses authors had been unaware of the fact that the license they signed with NLC allowed for the sale of their theses  Concerns were expressed by a number of graduate students and others to the effect that the agreement between NLC and UMI  allowing UMI to sell copies of theses  violated a fundamental principle to ensure freedom of access to scholarly information  To quote William Maes  University Librarian at Dalhousie University and a speaker at the consultation   Does the current commercial situation lead us down a path that restricts access to the very things we produced  This issue is not that different from our current situation with journal publication where authors freely give up their rights in order to be published  while the very reason for publishing is thwarted by the high cost of getting that information back      Part of today s   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  discussion emanates from a belief that electronic theses will bring down costs and allow us to take back ownership of the distribution and preservation of our own works   Maes 2000    4  THE THESES CANADA PORTAL Out of the consultation came the proposal for a Canadian portal for electronic theses  As per one of the recommendations a national advisory committee was established for the Canadian Theses Service  At the same time theses and systems staff at NLC got to work developing a proposal for a searchable collection of Canadian theses on AMICUS  Canada s national online catalogue  This ambitious proposal was finished by spring 2002  It included the addition of abstracts to bibliographic records  the development of a web based search interface for the numerous theses and dissertations in NLC s collection and of several new search indexes specific to theses  It also included a proposal for the acquisition of theses digitized for the national program by UMI  which was a requirement of the contract in effect at the time  This proposal became the foundation for the Theses Canada Portal  Over the course of the fall of 2002 and throughout 2003 the design and systems development for the Portal was done  On April 1  2003  in keeping with the new direction of the national program and to match the name chosen for the Portal  the Canadian Theses Service changed its name to Theses Canada  Throughout 2003 UMI sent NLC electronic versions of all the theses it had digitized under the terms of the contract in effect between 1998 and August 2002  In all NLC received over 45 000 ETDs in PDF format from UMI  The Theses Canada Portal was launched on January 29  2004 at the Ontario Library Association Superconference  It provided access to NLC s extensive collection of theses and dissertations on microform  a collection that currently numbers over 250 000  It also provided free online access to the subset of ETDs received from UMI as well as extensive information about the national program  In 2004 the theses and dissertations were indexed so that clients could do full text searching of the contents  The Portal can be accessed at http   www collectionscanada ca thesescanada   5  BUILDING A NATIONAL ETD PROGRAM AT LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES CANADA While the launch of the Theses Portal and the provision of open access to a large number of ETDs was a significant achievement  it still left the national theses program dependent on sources outside NLC to realize its mandate  NLC s agreement with its contractor precluded the provision of immediate open access to the theses digitized on its behalf  What was needed was a way of  in the words of Bill Maes  taking back ownership of the distribution and preservation of Canadian theses and dissertations  At its second meeting  in October 2002  the Canadian Theses Service Advisory Committee  now the Theses Canada Advisory Committee   struck a technical sub committee composed of representatives from CTS  l Universite Laval and the University of Waterloo  The sub committee was charged with resolving problems with respect to the transition to electronic theses in Canada and to develop the means for universities to send their ETDs directly to the NLC  This second objective was the direct result of concerns expressed at the national consultation in 2000  At the same meeting the Advisory Committee recommended that the Canadian Theses Service conduct a pilot project to acquire e theses from l Universite Laval and the University of Waterloo  Both universities had already established ETD submission programs    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The sub committee began its discussions in January 2003 and its work progressed concurrently with the development of the Theses Canada Portal  Its first task was to decide how the NLC would acquire ETDs from universities  The advantages of setting up a national electronic thesis program at NLC based on the Open Archives Initiative  OAI  protocol for metadata harvesting were immediately apparent  Once NLC was set up as both an OAI service provider and data provider it could harvest metadata for ETDs from universities and in turn make it available for harvesting by other organizations such as the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   In developing its harvesting program NLC faced a challenge that most institutions do not have  In order to continue to expand its collection of theses and dissertations  thus fulfilling the institution s mandate to acquire and preserve Canada s bibliographic heritage for current and future generations  NLC wanted to harvest not only theses metadata but the electronic theses and dissertations themselves   6  THE PILOT PROJECT In October 2003 the technical sub committee met in Ottawa  along with representatives from LAC s Information Technology Branch and Standards Division  to make some decisions about formats  standards  etc   which were needed before the pilot project could begin  Programming for the LAC harvester and repository was done after the meeting and the harvester was ready by the end of 2003  An extension was written to the harvesting program to allow for the harvesting of the e theses themselves  The pilot project was originally intended to last for six months with an original time frame of April 1 to September 30  2004  In fact the pilot project lasted a year  April 2004 to March 2005   allowing LAC to include two additional universities  the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Manitoba  LAC learned valuable lessons working with both of these universities  The University of Saskatchewan developed its ETD submission program using the ETD db freeware from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  which allows a thesis to include multiple PDF files  The harvesting program at LAC  on the other hand  had been written on the basis of harvesting only one PDF file per thesis  Participation of the University of Saskatchewan allowed LAC to identify this weakness in its program  which will be fixed when sufficient time and resources are available  The University of Manitoba set up its ETD program using the DSpace institutional repository software that the University Library had already started to implement  This was Library and Archives Canada s first opportunity to harvest ETDs from this popular institutional repository software  It turned out to be serendipitous in that it was discovered that DSpace only supports metadata in the Dublin Core  DC  metadata standard  As a result  the programmer at the University of Manitoba developed an DC to ETDms  metadata standard for ETDs  crosswalk which is now available to other implementers of DSpace for ETDs  Over the course of the pilot project LAC harvested 693 records and corresponding theses from the four participating universities  The records were converted to MARC 21 and uploaded to AMICUS on March 30  2005  In April 2005 LAC staff reviewed the records  which they found to be good quality access records although the records do not fully comply with international standards  Several problems with the conversion  largely related to the appearance of punctuation and mathematical scientific symbols in the abstract note  needed to be addressed  During 2005 the problems  which are related to coding  were fixed insofar as possible and the decision was made to start harvesting other universities as they implement ETD submission programs  There are a few requirements  technical   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  and general  that universities must build into their programs for LAC to be able to harvest their ETDs  Guidelines are available from Theses Canada  LAC is now working with the University of New Brunswick and the University of Victoria in order to harvest their ETDs and has plans to enhance the OAI program this fiscal year    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations

Theses Service started to develop the Theses Canada Portal  the University of Waterloo was the only Canadian university with an established ETD submission program  L Universite Laval had finished its pilot project and was just starting to accept ETDs  In January 2004  in order to determine the status of ETD initiatives at that time  Theses Canada conducted a short survey which revealed that out of its fifty six university partners that had not yet set up ETD submission programs twenty two  or 40   were either interested in setting one up or were in the planning or pilot project phase  Only five universities  9   expressed no interest in ETDs  During the winter of 2005 2006 Theses Canada conducted a more detailed telephone survey with 47 of its university participants to update and enhance the information it obtained in the 2004 survey  Thirteen universities with very small graduate schools were not surveyed  Theses Canada now has an accurate picture of the status of ETD initiatives that are currently taking place at Canadian universities  which will help in the development of future plans  7 1 Survey Results  Eight universities have ETD submission programs of which LAC is harvesting six  One cannot be harvested at this time because of technical problems and the eighth university needs to be contacted again  A ninth university  Simon Fraser  does not have an ETD submission program but is digitizing the print theses it currently approves  The remaining 38 universities fell into one of five categories    Pilot projects in progress   3   Planning pilot projects   4   Proposals for approval under development   5   Informal discussions taking place   11   No current plans   15 Those universities either planning or conducting pilot projects include some of Canada s large and prestigious universities such as l Universite du Quebec a Montreal and Queen s University  The DSpace institutional repository software is proving to be a popular choice   at least 9 universities have implemented it  although one university has determined that it is not sufficient for its requirements   8  AUTHOR ISSUES The majority of theses authors support the principle of open access to ETDs  however a small percentage of them do have concerns  These concerns invariably fall into one of two categories  damage to future publication potential and or the possibility that their research will be plagiarized  8 1 Future Publication Potential A small number of students are concerned that making their electronic theses and dissertations widely accessible on the Theses Canada Portal will have a negative impact on their ability to publish them commercially however  in an informal survey conducted during the fall of 2003 by the Graduate Students  Association of Canada  GSAC   Taylor and Francis  the University of Toronto Press  the University of Alberta Press and the University of British Columbia Press indicated that there would be no negative impact on their decision to publish manuscripts based upon a student s dissertation if the theses were first   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  made available on the Theses Canada Portal  In fact some publishers thought that the Portal initiative was a very positive step  Theses Canada recommends that authors with concerns contact potential publishers in advance to determine whether or not prior access to their electronic theses via the Theses Canada Portal will prevent publication of all or part of their theses later on  To determine the publishing policy of various academic journals graduate students can check the Academic Journal Policy Database at www etd uc edu journal  Universities that accept ETDs generally provide various levels of access restriction to deal with such problems  8 2 Plagiarism A small number of theses authors are concerned that exposing their research on the Internet will leave it open to plagiarism  In the UNESCO ETD Guide  Dr  Jean Claude Guedon  from the Universite de Montreal  points out that  by apparently giving away the results of his her work  a scientist ensures his her intellectual property most effectively and that the ability to compare new results to already published work makes plagiarism a very risky business    He goes on to point out that placing theses online and maximizing their visibility offers a very efficient way to protect intellectual property and prevent plagiarism  Guedon  2001    9  ETDs BENEFIT AUTHORS The single most significant benefit to theses authors relates to the increase in citation impact for online research of anywhere from 50 to 250   As a reflection of the degree of uptake of research results by other researchers this can contribute to rewards from universities through employment  increased salary and promotion and rewards from research funders  Harnad  2005   Publication of electronic theses and dissertations results in additional benefits such as    free publicity for post graduate level research   the authors of electronic theses become much more widely known and as a result their reputations and status are enhanced    easy worldwide access to their theses for colleagues and collaborators    easy worldwide access to their theses for job and grant applications    the ability to include multimedia in ETDs    a raised profile for their research institutions  and    savings from not having to print  copy and bind paper theses   10  CONCLUSION In the next two to three years it s expected that many of the universities currently in the planning or pilot stages of their ETD initiatives will put ETD submission programs in place  This will be a busy period for Theses Canada as it starts to harvest theses and metadata from many of its partners while at the same time maintaining the traditional program it provides through ProQuest Information and Learning  However in three years the development of a national electronic theses program at Library and Archives Canada will be well on its way
