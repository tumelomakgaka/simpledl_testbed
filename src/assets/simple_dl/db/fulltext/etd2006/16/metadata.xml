that is made possible with electronic submission benefits researchers  A significant increase in positive impact occurs when an electronic submission program moves from being optional to being a requirement stated in the University s thesis regulations  While the advantages are numerous  the process of moving to required electronic submission and open access must be carried out methodically  with an eye to implications for all stakeholders  The particular focus of this paper will be on the practical experience of the University of Waterloo  where the motion to require electronic submission passed in the spring of 2006  Keywords  electronic theses and dissertations  graduate studies  required open access  technical logistical philosophical implications  I  EVOLUTION TO THE ELECTRONIC REQUIREMENT 1  Required Electronic Submission In 1996  when the University of Waterloo began to investigate the feasibility of electronic submission and dissemination of theses  a key motivating factor was the promise of increased access to the rich content  The potential of the Internet to disseminate information  to provide remote access  and enhance scholarly communication  was inspiring  Electronic information  searchable and remotely accessible  could bring the products of the University of Waterloo s graduate students onto the desktops of researchers around the world  Staff from the Graduate Studies Office  the Library  and the Information Systems   Technology computing department  as well as numerous graduate students and faculty  formed the core investigation team  We saw many issues that were complex and required careful consideration  After three years we were prepared to introduce electronic submission as an option  In the fall of 1999  eight University of Waterloo graduate students submitted their theses online and authorized open access to them  We ve seen a steady increase in electronic submissions in the past seven years  We had 33 submissions in 2000  The numbers have increased each year  In 2005  nearly 35  of graduate student chose to submit online  As of May 2006 the percentage approaches 50  voluntary online submission  Nearly 600 theses are available in the local open access database    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  In the progression to this phase  we faced challenges and developed solutions  Initially our policy was to require postscript as the submission format  We were concerned with long term viability  PostScript was a well established format and was a standard for electronic submission in the early days of electronic journals  As the PDF format grew more ubiquitous and with all but the most tech savvy students dissuaded by the PostScript requirement  the decision was made to allow PDF as a submission format  Long term preservation concerns were alleviated by the decision to include our Masters theses as well as dissertations in Library and Archives Canada microfilm program  As the ETD submission procedures stabilized and the option grew increasingly popular  the decision was made to make the electronic submission the official university copy  In this paper  we  all members of the Project Team  will describe to you the process of moving from an option to required electronic submission and open access  We will describe how we accomplished the change to the academic regulations  We ll describe the practical impact of the move for Graduate Studies Office workflow  We place a high priority on communications with administrators  faculty  and graduate students  Communication forums are comprehensive and ongoing  Support mechanisms are in place  Web based as well as face to face  and both technical and logistical  Functional and technical specifications ensure the benefits of open access with metadata conforming to the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting   2  Required Open Access From October 1  2006  paper based theses are no longer be accepted by the Graduate Studies Office  All thesis submissions must be online  In coming to this crossroad  we faced issues of a philosophical nature  We ve addressed questions about preservation  future access  access restrictions  alternative formatting  and inclusion of non traditional components  We anticipate that new issues will arise and acknowledge that policies can be open to evolution  As a team  we are committed to providing strong communication channels  The communication channels in place will ensure that issues will come to light and be addressed  Our electronically submitted theses are all  without exception  installed in our locally maintained open access database  Metadata are OAI compliant and harvested by a variety of service providers  We have no plans to provide levels of access in the database  Our students can apply for permission to have circulation of their thesis restricted for a year  Such permission is typically granted in cases where the thesis has a patent pending  Such theses will be maintained on a Graduate Studies Office server for a year before they are uploaded to the database  The benefits of open access for authors and researchers are well documented  Previously only available on site or through purchase  theses have been a hidden wealth of valuable content  Exposure of this material can be a boon for the reputation of the university  the career and publication potential of the author  and the contribution to the advancement of scholarly communication   II  GRADUATE STUDIES OFFICE 1  Academic Regulations The Graduate Studies Office partnered with the University of Waterloo Library and Information Systems and Technology in 1996 to collaborate on issues related to access  storage  submission    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses

access  Graduate students and faculty participated in the early phases of the project  The transition from paper bound only to voluntary electronic submission for the University copy and then required electronic submission was lengthy and involved several stages to change University regulations for degree completion and submission  and operational responsibilities of the Graduate Studies Office  In 1999  the first proposal made to our Graduate Operations Committee  chaired by the Dean of Graduate Studies  was considered too extreme for the academic community  We proposed that electronic submission would replace all bound copy requirements  The leap from minimum bound paper copies for the University  supervisor and department to a single electronic submission requiring electronic access was modified to voluntary electronic submission of the University copy  Many departments were determined to maintain their theses libraries  and most supervisors preferred a bound copy rather than electronic access  The central concern in the academic community was the belief that electronic theses were less significant than bound paper theses and not the accepted standard for university libraries  Over time  this concern diminished as documents such as e journals became more accepted and archival copies of theses  microfilm or fiche  were affirmed as the standard for preservation  In addition  the limitations for all types of space continued to challenge universities  The change to the submission regulations in 2004 was the turning point for the Graduate Studies Office  Space limitations for binding operations combined with a review to streamline and reduce activities in the office narrowed our focus on the University copy of the thesis  A recommendation to move binding operations to our graphics department was approved and allowed us to concentrate on the review of theses at the submission preparation phase  communicate the benefits of electronic thesis and increase student participation and academic interest  Many students were supportive of the move to electronic thesis because it opened possibilities for increasing exposure to their work and accommodate the creative aspects to their thesis including colour  and the integration of enhanced objects in their theses  Early in 2006  a proposal to require only an electronic copy of the thesis for the University was approved by the Graduate Operations Committee  The recommendation to the Senate Graduate   Research Council was a change to the graduate degree requirement of electronic submission for the University copy  Faculties would regulate bound copy requirements for their departments and supervisors   2  On line Thesis Regulations The GSO embraced on line documentation beginning in the early 1990 s  The Thesis Regulations and other regulatory documents including the Graduate Studies Calendar  Organization of Graduate Studies  The Supervisory Process  A Guide for Faculty and Graduate Students were converted for on line use  This transition was concurrent with UW ETD project  The University community embraced this form of publication and as of 2004  only electronic documents versions were published on our web site    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  0The Thesis Regulations document includes format instructions and samples  information on copyright and the use of copyrighted material  completion of degree requirements and thesis submission deadlines  submission instructions  University services including courses and support for the preparation of theses  publication in microform information  and a Thesis Non exclusive License form  IST courses on the preparation of thesis and the availability of templates were critical to the success of the project and minimize review and submission issues for the students and the Graduate Studies Office   3  Operations The Graduate Studies Office oversees the on line Thesis Regulations document  reviews and approves theses prior to submission  holds theses restricted from circulation  and transmits theses to ProQuest following each University convocation  These operations are administered by a Thesis Manager  Acceptance of the thesis by a student s thesis committee is required prior to final review and submission of the University copy  Students are sent an electronic acknowledgement confirming that their thesis meets the University requirements  or  a form identifying required changes and instructions for resubmission  Students who wish to apply for restrictions on circulation of their thesis due to patents pending  or other circumstances  complete a Request to Restrict Circulation of Thesis form  This form must be fully approved and submitted before any restrictions will be applied to the circulation of the thesis  at least one week prior to the submission of the actual thesis for examination  Theses withheld by the GSO for a maximum of one year   4  Communications The GSO promotes the IST courses and the University support services each term in the Graduate Studies Newsletter and in the Thesis Regulations document  In May 2006  the ETD project team invited faculty  staff and students to the first of a series of information sessions to provide information on benefits  preparation and submission of electronic thesis  These sessions were implemented to prepare students and the Graduate Studies community for the new regulation for electronic thesis effective October 2006   5  Collaboration The continued collaboration of the UW Library  Information Systems and Technology department  and the Graduate Studies Office is key to the on going success of electronic thesis at the University of Waterloo as regulations are refined and technology advances   III  SOFTWARE ISSUES   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  1  Thesis Creation The main software supported for electronic thesis preparation at the University of Waterloo is Microsoft Word  The University of Waterloo has a site license for this product  A Microsoft Word template is available for students to use as a starting point when creating their thesis in Microsoft Word  LaTeX is available on most if not all Unix systems on campus  Students in some faculties also use other software  such as Adobe InDesign   but this  other software  is generally supported by the faculty  Microsoft Word is available on all on campus  Nexus  labs  Our  Nexus  labs are Windows XP managed computers and all of them have Microsoft Office XP on them   2  Converting to PDF LaTeX and Macintosh OS have built in PDF creation tools and so no special software is needed to support conversion to PDF for students using these operating systems  The Windows applications available on campus do not have built in PDF creation tools  After investigating various options  including Active PDF  the desktop version is no longer supported and has been replaced by PrimoPDF   PDF Creator  Ghost Script  and Cute PDF  we decided to purchase a few copies of Adobe Acrobat Pro to be made available on some of our student lab  Nexus  computers on campus  We don t have a campus wide site license for Adobe Acrobat Pro  but we do have a Campus Licensed Program that allows us to install it on university campus computers for  80 per machine  students can purchase it for home use for  55 through the Adobe Student Licensing Program   We are putting it on a few student lab  Nexus  computers in each faculty and we are also installing it on some computers in our consulting offices  Once electronic thesis is the degree requirement  after September 2006  we will see if this meets our students  needs  If necessary  we will install it on more student lab  Nexus  computers  Reasons for choosing Adobe Acrobat Professional include  Quality of hyperlinks  being able to link to a URL from either a URL or any text   availability of bookmarks  quality of images in the PDF file  ability to optimize PDF files  and ability to merge PDF files  Documentation related to electronic theses http   www adobe com education etd tutorials html  is  available  on  Adobe s  site   IV  SUPPORT 1  Courses Electronic thesis support courses offered by Information Systems and Technology  IST  include  Techniques for Managing Theses Using Microsoft Word  LaTeX Issues for Electronic Thesis Submission  and Submitting Your Thesis Online  Courses are offered at least once a term and will be offered on demand during implementation of change in regulations toward required electronic submission  Faculties and graduate student groups may also request  special request  courses for their area  Topics include  Theses

Acrobat Professional for students in their office   V  SYSTEMS SPECIFICATIONS 1  Functional The primary guideline for the development of the technical portion of the electronic thesis submission program at the University of Waterloo was to make the system self sustaining  The   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  idea was to avoid the introduction of a new workload and materials handling stream into an already busy technical services operation  Students would be made responsible for the creation of their own metadata records and almost all other aspects of the submission process  The system would have to be Web based to allow record creation and thesis submission from anywhere on the Internet  Students sometimes do not submit the final version of their theses until long after they have left the campus  Only valid University of Waterloo students would have access to the metadata record creation and thesis submission process so an authentication method was required  It was also recognized that students would probably wish to edit and re edit their metadata record any number of times right up until the moment of final acceptance  Similarly students would need the ability to submit and resubmit their electronic theses with changes either requested by the Graduate Office or to correct errors discovered in the document  Since multimedia was recognized as one of the enhancement potentials of the submission of the electronic theses  the system was also required to handle the submission of multipart items  Access to the metadata record for adjustment and the resubmission of the actual thesis should be allowed right up until the official acceptance of the thesis  Once accepted by the department the metadata record can no longer be adjusted and the submission of revised copies of the thesis is prevented   2  Technical The University of Waterloo s electronic thesis submission program was developed using Macromedia s ColdFusion with a Microsoft SQL Server backend  Separate servers are used for the ColdFusion supplemented Web server and the database server  The electronic thesis program is one of many Web services provided by the University of Waterloo Library that is handled by these servers  The Library is currently exploring the use of DSpace from MIT to operate an Institutional Repository  This is Open Source software which should allow the addition of any capabilities required to duplicate the service of our current submission system   3  Metadata Record Creation and Thesis Submission To access the electronic thesis submission process  students must authenticate themselves against UWDir  the University of Waterloo s LDAP server  Once authenticated  if it is the student s first access to the submission process  they are presented with a metadata submission form  The metadata submission form is used to collect author identification information and basic bibliographic information describing the theses  The Waterloo user ID  collected during the authentication process and matching the student s unique account in the University s LDAP Directory  is used in the construction of file and directory names in combination with the year of submission  e g  ktchan2005 pdf   Students are asked to enter only ASCII data in the record  Any required special characters are created using HTML tags  A link to a table of iso8859 1 entity references is included in the instruction  6   Links to a help page popup are provided for each field to assist the student to correctly complete the form  Input data is verified wherever possible  The student ID number  for example  is checked to ensure that it is numeric  All essential fields are indicated on the   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  submission form and a record cannot be submitted until all these fields have been completed  Drop down selection boxes for department  degree  year and language are used to ensure consistent input of common data  For the year of submission the system automatically generates the previous  current and three future years for selection  This avoids having to update the form annually  If the student has already submitted a record and the thesis has not yet been officially accepted  its status is  Temporary   Students can enter their ID numbers to get access for editing the metadata or submitting or re submitting their theses  When a metadata record is entered or adjusted by a student the record is displayed for proofreading in the format that it will appear when the record is available for public access  Hidden fields appear in a list at the bottom of the display for verification  Once confirmed  the metadata record is written to the database with a  Temporary  status assigned that remains until the thesis is accepted officially  The student may access the records as many times as required up until acceptance of the thesis is official  The graduate studies office notifies the library that the thesis is officially accepted  Library staff moves the file to the permanent ETD server and use the administrative module to change the status of the metadata record to  Accepted   An administrative module allows access to submitted records  Records may be edited  deleted or have their status changed from  Temporary  to  Accepted  or  Pending   An  Accepted  status triggers the record for public display and closes off access for further editing to the student  A record with  Pending  status  for example in cases where a patent is pending  will be updated to  Accepted  after a period of time  normally within a year  The use of popup help pages for each field in the submission form  drop down selection menus  required field alerts and input verification JavaScripts where possible  are all designed to achieve the objective of a self sustaining system   VI  ACCESS 1  Public Interface Once a thesis has been accepted  it is added to the ETD server for public access  The URL pointing to the ETD Server is generated automatically by the system constructing the file name from the UW user ID and the year of submission  When the status of the metadata record is set to  Accepted  it is immediately available for public access  The public display provides access to the thesis database  A quick search provides an All Fields  Subject Keywords  which includes assigned subject terms as well as keywords added by the student   Author  Title and Year search options  A program search drop down selection menu  including only those programs with at least one submitted electronic thesis  returns all records submitted to the program  All search methods return a brief display of records with links to a full record display  The full display minus hidden fields is identical to that used by the student to proofread their records  An automatically constructed URL points a user to the complete PDF version of the theses on the ETD Server  The objective of creating a self sustaining submission program with minimal maintenance has been achieved  Students perform almost all the tasks required for the submission program  Aside from the evaluation of the theses  its placement on the ETD server after acceptance and the   9th International Symposium on Electronic

administrative effort is required for the system to operate  2  Dissemination of Metadata An OAI PMH module was developed  Records can be retrieved in Dublin Core or oai etdms  format  Waterloo s records are available for harvesting and are currently being harvested by Theses Canada  the ETD Union Catalog of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  and the CARL  Canadian
