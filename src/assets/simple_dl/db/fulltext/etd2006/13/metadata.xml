<fulltext>9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  ETD s as pilot materials for long term preservation efforts in kopal Thomas Wollschlager  German National Library wollschlaeger dbf ddb de  ABSTRACT Since summer 2004  the German National Library  GNL  and several partners are conducting a project called kopal  with the objective to establish a technology platform for a long term preservation repository in Germany  Electronic theses and dissertations are the first archival objects to be imported into the kopal archive system  They represent the first online publications that have been archived by GNL since 1998  and these over 45 000 documents provide the largest ETD collection in Europe  As a national library  GNL has the task to provide unimpeachable long term access to these high value scientific documents  At the same time  their overall consistency  the well established metadata format and the complete coverage by the stable URN referencing system make them ideal objects for pilot long term preservation efforts  The paper includes a general introduction into the kopal concept and its implementation policy  It addresses specific challenges with ETD s in terms of formats and workflows in the prototypical process  The variety of ETD formats from German universities is being discussed with the focus on how the various formats and their continuing access can be long term preserved by kopal   1  CHALLENGES OF THE DIGITAL LONG TERM PRESERVATION To maintain a responsible care for their digital collections that have been grown considerably over the past year  universities  libraries and other memory institutions need suitable and consistent archives for the electronic materials  The existing archives in most cases do not  however  fulfil the demands to be a socalled  trustworthy archive   The considerations of the GNL for its digital long term archive focussed on the following needs    As a basis  the binary data have to be preserved  No existing data carrier is lasting forever or even long enough  The first CD ROM s are becoming unreadable already now  and for complex materials  e g   multimedia applications  the loss of single bits might become fatal  Therefore  the archive should be able to conduct regular bitstream preservation  data carrier migrations   Recent experiences with the nonoptimal integrity of certain document servers also indicate that the long term archive should rely on multiple copies of the archived content in physically separated places    The fast technology changes progressional hinder the access to older file formats  Many formats already exist  new ones are being developed  whereas current formats diminish or become obsolete  Additionally  there exist complex dependencies between those formats and various software and hardware environments  The archive should be able to allow constant format migrations  regular conversions  as well as emulations  re enacting of needed systems   What are the advantages or disadvantages of these strategies  During migration  older file formats are converted into more recent one s early enough  as long as they are still readable  That s being done continuously and means to preserve the integrity and availability of the digital resource in spite a changing environment  There is  however  the risk of possible   but maybe undetected   loss of information  parts  during automatically performed migration routines  The more complex the source format  the more   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin

hand  the ideal approach for large amounts of data and will be the most reasonable procedure for the more static data  e g   text and unmoving pictures   During emulation  a special program  the emulator  tries to re enact an older system environment onto a present system environment  e g   the DOS emulation on WinXP platforms   The goal is to be able to execute programs and process data that originally were intended for another  historical system on a recent system  That can be very extensive and presupposes a very exact definition of hardware and software requirements  The advantage of emulations  however  is to be most suitable for complex formats  e g   multimedia applications  to keep the features of that formats usable as long as possible  That means  both strategies have advantages and disadvantages  therefore  an archive system whose task is to provide long term preservation as well as long term availability of digital resources should be able to use a combination of both strategies  When looking at the format variants of ETD s at the GNL  it becomes clear why that flexibility is of such importance   2  STRUCTURE OF THE ETD COLLECTION AT GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY The GNL is collecting online doctoral and post doctoral theses and dissertations since 1997  Their number exceeds 44 500 at present and forms the largest ETD collection in Europe  The annual growth has levelled off at   10 000 ETD s per year  resulting in an accumulated data amount of   350 Gigabytes at present  The ETD s are delivered from the German universities  at present  83 out of 90 universities are actively delivering their ETD s   All are accessible via the OPAC of GNL  and they are accessible for free and in full text  except a tiny amount for legal   mostly patent related   reasons   That has led to a widespread access and use of these ETD s  now exceeding 350 000 access cases month1  Corresponding to the scientific value of these documents and their excellent availability for scientific research  the ETD s form the most used and most respected digital collection of GNL  Therefore  it is the major task of GNL to preserve that collection for long term use  The major challenge for their long term preservation arises from the fact that the German ETD s are delivered in numerous file formats  From the beginning of the German DissOnline project s  onwards  the use of innovative file formats has been encouraged over the years  in fact  the use of innovative presentation methods by publishing the theses online has greatly contributed to the great acceptance of ETD s in the German scientific community  These ETD s contain 3 D images   simulations  embedded audio and video files  executables and other file types  However  the first file types are beginning to become hard to access due to the disappearance of suitable viewer applications  It has therefore become imperative to transfer the German ETD s into a suitable long term archive  On the other hand  if the ETD s at GNL were successfully long term preserved and their future accessibility ensured  it would have been proven that all the other digital publications that GNL has collected and will collect still  could be subjected to the long term preservation efforts as well because the highly innovative nature of the ETD s already would have covered all format   content preservation issues  That considerations led to the use of the ETD s as pilot materials for the GNL s longterm preservation efforts within the project  kopal    3  PRINCIPLES OF THE KOPAL ARCHIVE

Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada   kopal  stands for the Co operative Development of a Long Term Digital Information Archive  The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research for a three year period  to mid 2007  total volume of funding   4 2 million   The core of the project is the IBM Digital Information Archiving System  DIAS  solution  developed for the National Library of the Netherlands2  The goal of the kopal project is to develop a technological and organizational solution to ensure the long term availability of electronic publications  After the project financing phase  the resulting archive system will be integrated into the running environment of the participating libraries  Thereby  the transparent integration into existing library systems and the re usability by memory institutions play a critical role  In the implementation of the kopal system  international standards for long term archiving and metadata will be adopted  In this way  both sustainability and the ability to further develop the system are guaranteed  As part of the project  massive amounts of digital materials of all types from two partner organizations  the German National Library and the Goettingen State and University Library  will be deposited  The materials will range from digital documents like ETD s  electronic journals and digitized collections in the form of PDF  TIFF  or TeX files to complex objects like digital videos  The technical operation of the long term archive is located at the Gesellschaft fuer wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Goettingen  GWDG   The participation of IBM Germany as a development partner enables the professional customization of the software components  IBM will also provide longterm support  The archive itself is located at the GWDG site in Goettingen  Objects are being transferred into the system by secure Internet connections  GWDG has a vast experience in safe and secure data hosting and bitstream preservation  GWDG stores the data in two copies at their main site and in two additional copies at a physically different place in Goettingen  Furthermore  from the end of 2006 onwards  a third institution in Munich will receive an additional copy of each object for added security  Thus  the kopal project can fall back on a distributed data storage if needed3  Additionally  the logical structure of kopal adheres to several important principles  namely universality  reusability and flexibility  3 1 Universality The project aims to build a universally usable archival system in which long term availability is supported through migration and emulation  There are no limitations within kopal as regards the type of material which can be imported into the archive  text  images  audio  video  and possible data formats  Although the kopal system has a limited total capacity for the project s lifetime  the size of the individual archive object is unlimited  Each of the partners is completely free when it comes to the selection of  and setting of rules for  the import of its collected objects  3 2 Reusability Reuse of kopal by other institutions that need long term archiving is expressly desired  From its inception  the kopal solution has been geared towards a number of different needs  On the one hand  there is the option for a user to have its own  locker  within the system  i e  secure storage space with data under its own administrative control  This solution is especially appropriate for institutions with a small amount of material to be archived  On the other hand  an institution can reuse the kopal solution by installing the DIAS system itself  In order to guarantee reusability  established standards are applied  The transfer of objects into a digital archive via standardised formats  paths and interfaces is a key requirement in this context  The kopal  2 3  See http   www kb nl dnp e depot dm dias en html That principle is in some ways comparable to the LOCKSS approach  see http   www lockss org    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  project has therefore devised the  Universal Object Format  for this purpose  which enables digital objects to be archived with  technical  metadata and exchanged between institutions and systems4  3  Flexibility The DIAS software is also being enhanced with flexible modules  DIAS is based on IBM s standard software components  GNL and Goettingen State and University Library are therefore building software products onto the DIAS core which will be published as the  kopal Library for Retrieval and Ingest   koLibRI  under an open source licence  These kopal tools primarily support the import of objects into the archive and access to the archived objects  The development of the system is designed to be as open as possible  enabling cooperative use to be extended to all other archiving organisations  libraries  archives and museums  with an interest in reusing the system   Ill  1  Outline of the kopal archive system  The inner core refers to the OAIS model  The koLibRI software handles the creation of the archive objects and their retrieval   4  PRESERVATION PROCESS OF ARCHIVED ETD s BY KOPAL In effect  the following preservation strategy shall be executable by the kopal system    Migrate the object  e g   a certain ETD  with the precise identifier xxx into the new format yyy  Or    Migrate all objects of  or  more exactly  all files within all objects that contain  the format xxx and or  4  See http   kopal langzeitarchivierung de index objektspezifikation php en   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  that have been ingested before a certain date and or that are larger than yyy MB into the new format xyz  e g  from TIFF to PNG   In fact  the migration of objects with TIFF images into objects with PNG or JPEG2000 images will be the first migration path that shall be executed during the project time of kopal  In addition to the migration of objects  the implementation of emulation view paths will take place  Because of the complex structure of emulators and emulation processes  the basis for emulation paths will be implemented as a second step during the course of 2007  The basis for the execution of migration and or emulation processes are technical metadata  In kopal  the technical metadata are stored in METS5 containers that are being packed into one transport unit  together with the actual object  before ingesting into the archive  The METS container includes technical metadata according to the LMER standard  Long term Preservation Metadata for Electronic Resources 6  How are these metadata being created  That process consists of two steps  First  extracting technical metadata as they are delivered with the ETD itself  second  generating additional technical metadata by using appropriate tools  The first step has an excellent basis in the new metadata format for the German ETD s  the XMetaDiss standard7  In the XMetaDiss format  an entire section has been devoted to technical metadata  element  ddb fileProperties   It can  and should  contain information on file ID  format  character set  file size  creation application etc  These data are being integrated into the METS file of the archive object  An example for the metadata structure of an archived ETD  including these extracted data from XMetaDiss  is shown in the following picture   5  Metadata Encoding   Transmission Standard  see http   www loc gov standards

archive object  It represents an ETD  consisting of a main document   Text    an abstract and bibliographic metadata  The appropriate tags in the File Section   fileSec   contain information extracted from the XMetaDiss metadata   In addition to the extracted metadata  the tool JHOVE8 is being used to generate additional technical metadata for each file of the ETD to be archived  In the above picture  the JHOVE output would be stored in the  techMD  sections for each file of the ETD  We are confident that this structure will allow the mentioned preservation strategies   4  MATERIALS FOR PRESERVATION AFTER ETD PILOT As mentioned before  the successful ingest and exemplary migration of the ETD collection of GNL is the precondition for the planned ingest of all the other digital materials that GNL and Goettingen University possess  In case of GNL  that materials cumulate to quite a considerable amount of data    Electronic journals   serials  data amount    300 GB   CD ROM images  number    50 000 to 100 000  data amount    28 000 to 56 000 GB   Digitized materials  Exil Press Digital  from GNL     150 GB External digital collections    1 500 GB Digitised books from the German Book   Scripture Museum  GNL     5 000 GB  for starters  Born digital and digitised audio from the German Music Archive  GNL     544 000 GB  8  JSTOR Harvard Object Validation Environment  in short  JHOVE  version 1 0  release of 05 26 2005  with some bugfixes which will be also contained in the upcoming maintenance release  see http   hul harvard edu jhove    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  It should be mentioned that the carrier based digital collections have been digitized not nearly complete by now  in fact  that process will take several years  But already now  the kopal system has been design to be able to store more than the readily available data amount  An impression of the relationship between the potential materials that will be ingested into kopal  and the planned capacity for the project phase  is shown in the next picture   Ill  3  Planned data ingest for the kopal system with ETD s as the first content  The red line indicates the realistic amount of data to ingest until end 2007  logarithmic graph    5  NEXT STEPS   VISION A major part of the project work will be the integration of the archive system in the existing workflows of the library and the eventual creation of new workflows that incorporate the preservation strategy for the ETD s and other materials right from the delivery by the publishers  Since kopal does not provide an enduser access or a direct ingest from the outside  as can be seen in Ill  1  kopal supports and or provides interfaces to the collection acquisition side and to the user services   these components   the user interface and the placing of the materials to be ingested at the disposal of the kopal tools   have to be provided by the appropriate departments of the GNL  Of course  these departments  the IT department and the kopal team are working closely together to set up suitable interfaces and workflows  One example might illustrate a resulting task  In face of rising data amounts and large single objects  e g  digitised DVD ROM images with more than 8 GB each   it is very important to guarantee a sufficient performance of the system  When an end user clicks on a link within the search result display in the OPAC  the retrieval of the archived ETD from the kopal system starts  But  in case of those very large objects  it might take several minutes to get the object via the Net onto the screen  To prevent users from multiple clicking or simply walking away  fast Internet connections have to be provided for  and suitable access systems have to be implemented that facilitate an appropriate user support  e g   including messages on the needed retrieval time     9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The other major working package includes the implementation of a functioning Preservation Planning mechanism  Since the reference to precise file formats is an essential of any migration or emulation mechanism  the best support for the kopal   and any other long term preservation effort   would be the successful setup of a functioning international File Format Registry  Several international efforts  in which GNL is participating  are currently under way to cover that area  While that efforts are under way  kopal has to prove the performant migration of large data amounts as well as the successful implementation of emulation mechanisms until the end of 2007  And  finally  GNL and its partners will broaden their information  support   encouragement of ETD producers  including authors and universities  towards a more well founded format   preservation awareness  Projects as  DissOnline Tutor 9 with the aim of improving the technical quality and develop   procure tools to create and control long term archiveable ETD s are an example of these efforts  We also want to encourage other memory institutions to adapt to long term preservation solutions in order to protect  preserve and make available the digital cultural heritage of our times for future generations   On the author  Dr  Thomas Wollschlager is a digital preservation officer of the kopal project  and works for the Department of Information Technology at the German National Library in Frankfurt Main  Within the context of long term preservation of digital data and especially within kopal  he is responsible for the integration of the archive system in the workflows for electronic materials in the library  the co ordination of the departments and of external partners as well as for supporting the project controlling   9  http   www dissonline de Tutor   available only in German    </fulltext>
