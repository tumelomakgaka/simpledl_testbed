<fulltext>9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Added values to E theses A preliminary version  Sayeed Choudhury  sayeed jhu edu  Johns Hopkins University  Baltimore  USA Eva Muller  eva muller ub uu se  Uppsala University  Sweden  Abstract  Putting theses and dissertations online offers more than just the possibility to manage  store  organize and disseminate digital materials created by an institution and its community members  By developing new services which take advantage of the characteristics of electronic materials new values can be added to the original documents at the same time as some shortcomings can be overcome  The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of the main issues involved when the infrastructures supporting some of these new services are being constructed   E theses  e publishing and repositories It seems clear that electronic publishing systems and institutional repositories are becoming an established part of a general purpose infrastructure within our universities and that e theses are currently an important portion of the content stored within them  Though  the focus is mostly on the text based content  In the future it is important to support also other content such as multimedia and to support developments related to e science  The building of a bridging infrastructure between institutional repositories and infrastructure supporting preservation and curation of research data is one of challenges which we will be dealing with in the coming years   Added values to e theses Added values to e theses by linking to related resources or source data on which the e theses are based One of the most fundamental aspects of scientific scholarly communication is the ability to cite and examine data in a consistent manner  Without this ability  the very essence of the scientific method  with its requirement of validating results  becomes compromised  The JISC Briefing Paper  Data Deluge   http   www jisc ac uk index cfm name pub datadeluge  describes the unparalleled growth in data from e science projects  For example  large scale astronomy projects such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey  http   www sdss org  at Johns Hopkins University have gathered data at unprecedented rates  raising new challenges and opportunities  Through the International Virtual Observatory Alliance  IVOA  http   www ivoa net   astronomers have developed community wide metadata standards and web services that facilitate access and querying of these datasets  While science has always been data driven  e science  and increasingly computational humanities  has raised the importance of data to new levels  With the IVOA and other e science initiatives  it has become possible for graduate students and new researchers to access datasets for their research activities and for their e publications  Given this rapid rise in data and the accompanying use in e publications  it has become critical to develop a robust  viable data curation strategy  The JISC Briefing Paper  e Science Data Curation    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada   http   www jisc ac uk index cfm name pub escience  describes the fragility of these datasets  aspects of data curation and a set of recommendations to meet this important scholarly need  Added values to e theses by providing long term preservation and curation While there are major questions to address and technological and policy issues to explore  there are also notable components of infrastructure that might provide the necessary base for data curation  especially as it relates to e publications such as e theses  The digital repository represents a software foundation for digital preservation  It should be noted that storing content in a repository represents a necessary  but insufficient condition for digital preservation  Repositories provide an opportunity to manage digital content  including datasets  in such a way that consideration of digital preservation is a possibility  While some institutions rely solely on the institutional repositories  in some European countries there are experiences of building of infrastructure systems that support long term preservation in cooperation with national libraries or archives  It is becoming increasingly possible to build interfaces between repositories and applications or web services  As an example  Uppsala University and Johns Hopkins University are working together to evaluate e publishing systems  including Uppsala s DiVA  and appropriate connections to repositories  Working with astronomers at Johns Hopkins  the Sheridan Libraries are examining how the disseminators from the Fedora repository software can be interfaced with the web services offered through the Virtual Observatory framework  Such examinations and possible connections offer a technology infrastructure that can accommodate the appropriate policies for data curation as it relates to e theses   Added values to e theses by resolving legal issues Building seamless interfaces between repositories and applications or web services raises questions of importance for solutions for managing digital rights in this environment in a clear and effective way  The implementation of machine readable licenses based on rights management languages are a possible technical solution  Moreover  in a time when we are experiencing a growing number of students producing e theses  the question of plagiarism and how to deal with it is of immediate importance  Some universities in Sweden have implemented systems to analyze papers and theses for potential plagiarism  Such systems are provided by commercial companies like Urkund  www urkund com  or GenuineText  www genuinetext com   Additionally  cooperation between these companies and institutions running repositories   like DiVA group members prevents plagiarism through in depth indexing   Impact on the libraries As universities develop institutional repositories  the unit providing the infrastructure is most typically the library  It is important to be aware how these new roles and services affect libraries when it comes both to human resources and cooperation within the organization and outside it  In this particular context  the concept of  data scientist  is most relevant  This term has been used to describe an individual with significant knowledge and expertise with both digital libraries and a specific discipline  That is  these individuals represent the human interface between the repository experts and the researchers  There is a great need to train such individuals and to recognize their potential contributions within both the library and the scholarly realms  In addition to cooperation with the academics we serve with digital programs  libraries will need to develop or strengthen their relationships with the information technology providers inside and outside their universities  The challenges of data curation as it relates to e theses are both numerous and complex  In order to operate repositories successfully within university settings  it will be necessary to develop well defined and complementary roles with the central information technology units  For this particular relationship  it is extremely important to clarify that digital preservation entails more than storage of bits    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires

DiVA in Sweden   where a number of universities run and develop services together Moving beyond the organizational confines of the university  it will become essential to develop relationships with both non profit and for profit partners  For example in the US  Portico  http   www portico org  has recently secured a set of agreements with publishers for archiving e journals  In Europe  some National Libraries have established cooperation in this field with both publishers and university repositories  Finally  several for profit companies support existing e science projects  and have expressed an interest in repository projects  It would be worthwhile for libraries to explore and define conditions under which it is mutually beneficial to work with such companies   List of
