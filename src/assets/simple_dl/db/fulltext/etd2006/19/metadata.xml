theses for authors as well as for faculty and administrative staff  We highlight why and how we have proceeded in the process of gathering user requirements  as well as describing the technical developments  However  emphasis is placed on examples of use and the expected effects of the DIWA on the various actors in the production and information chain  Keywords  workflow system  pre publication process  undergraduate theses  INTRODUCTION How can we facilitate the management and publishing of undergraduate theses at large universities  as well as making the process smooth  efficient and rational  How can we help to improve the pre publication process and make it more reliable  It is essential for universities of all sizes to discuss these and similar issues  it is not merely a concern for larger universities  Uppsala University in Sweden is one of the largest Scandinavian universities with over 40 000 students annually  Since 2000  the majority of doctoral theses are available online via the DiVA publishing system1  developed and maintained by the DiVA Project within the Electronic Publishing Centre at the Uppsala University Library2  DiVA offers both publishing services and technical solutions for local repositories and is used today at an additional sixteen universities across Scandinavia  Currently more than 70  of the 400 doctoral theses produced every year at Uppsala University are published electronically through the DiVA system and a common workflow  supported by the current system  has been adopted by all doctoral students  However  when it comes to undergraduate theses the situation is different  Every year there are several thousand undergraduate theses produced at Uppsala University  In contrast to doctoral theses  these are managed at faculty level by the supervisors  administrators and examiners of the different educational programs  Since the practices adopted by various university departments differ somewhat  there is a need for more flexibility  This is also mirrored in their requirements as concerns a workflow system  1 2  For more information about DiVA  see http   www diva portal org http   en

Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  DIWA   Digital Workflow Application   is a workflow system for electronic publishing currently under development at the Electronic Publishing Centre at the Uppsala University Library  The main portion of DIWA is being developed within the DiVA project  though two other external bodies3 have provided additional resources  In 2005  as the first step in the development of a new workflow system  a working group within the DiVA consortium was initiated with the aim of identifying system and user requirements for the development of a more flexible and enhanced workflow for publishing of undergraduate theses in DiVA  This group carried out a survey with the aim of examining the management of undergraduate theses at different departments and faculties  The work of the group resulted in a specification for a new workflow system   DIWA  DIWA is intended to be an open source application and will also serve as a new component of the next version of the DiVA system   DiVA 2   METHODOLOGY One of the main challenges of this project has been to establish effective and efficient methods for understanding user needs and  in the next step  for expressing these in a fashion that allows efficient communications with systems developers  The methods used to support this are those typically applied in user centered design such as focus groups  interactive surveys and scenarios  The focus group consisting of system users from five Swedish universities has developed the survey jointly  The survey incorporates detailed interviews with faculty and administrative staff at five Swedish universities  These descriptions of current workflows and local practices for management of undergraduate theses have helped to specify desired user requirements  The results of the interviews were modeled as use cases and later translated into UML use case diagrams  In the requirement specification  both functional and user requirements are expressed as scenarios or paths through the separate use cases   User requirement specification Essential use cases in the specification mirror the difficulties that the undergraduate thesis management and reviewing processes often meet  For example  the reviewing process often involves several actors  e g  student  opponent  supervisor and examiner  all of whom need access to the thesis at different stages in the process  Other use cases reflect requirements such as document version checks  e mail and communication areas  digital storage of files etc   DIWA   Digital Workflow Application As proved by the results of the survey  one recurring issue that staff at large university departments have to deal with is the actual numbers of theses to be processed  and the necessity of keeping track of the stages in the procedure for each thesis  submission  reviewing  rewriting  final submission etc   In DIWA  this problem has been solved through a set of defined states which the document must pass through in order to be accepted and published  A chain of states is created when the system is initiated  and the user roles who may deal with the different states are also defined  E mails using templates may also be issued whenever there is a change of state for any particular thesis  Figure 1 below shows an example of a list of states  arranged from top to bottom  in a defined workflow for undergraduate theses   3  BIBSAM   National Co ordination and Development  http   www kb se bibsam  and Uppsala University  http   www uu se  2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 1  In DIWA  any document object  e g  undergraduate thesis  will follow a pre defined and customized  path  or  flow  based on a  flow template   The flow template is created when the system is initiated and constitutes the core of DIWA  It is possible to clone  basic  default templates and add or omit workflow components such as users or user roles  organizations  states or metadata  There is also built in support for importation of local information   e g  selection lists of users  educational courses  subjects etc  from various sources   Examples of use Each user role has access to a particular view of DIWA  For instance  an administrator may have access to system and workflow settings  but authors have access to files and metadata upload areas etc  Figure 2 below shows the view for workflow settings   3

Moreover  each user is able keep track of his or her assigned work through  My Worklist   e g  a list of objects that await action by the user  and refer to  My Objects   e g  user s manuscripts and their current status    Publishing and storage Any document object is stored along with a pre defined set of metadata which is completed at different stages in the process  When the undergraduate thesis is completed through DIWA  it is finally published via DiVA and stored in an XML based format  the DiVA Document Format  in local archives and repository   What makes DIWA different from other workflow systems  DIWA is tailored  but not limited  to workflows for electronic publishing within academic contexts  It is suitable not only for undergraduate theses  but for any type of electronic publication which requires some process of digital reviewing  and where the interaction between users powers the workflow  DIWA is based on open standards  Java technologies  and offers service centric functionality  Business processes and protocols can be described through BPEL to enable task sharing using a combination of web services  These external services can be incorporated into workflows when they are created in DIWA  building Service Oriented Architecture  SOA    EXPECTED OUTCOME  4   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The authors and academic staff involved in the processing of theses will reap many benefits from an advanced and flexible workflow system  The major advantage for both students and academic staff is that it will be easier and more reliable to keep track of the processing of theses  This may also exert a considerable effect on efficiency in terms of the time required  and costs  for the entire process  Moreover  by imposing standards on the metadata and templates for document processing  the final documents will be well structured and easy to integrate into other systems  if desired  This will bring benefits for university administrators as well as for librarians or staff running digital repositories  Librarians will be provided with facilities that enable them to easily integrate published material into library collections or local institutional repositories  as well as adding metadata information to their electronic catalogues  Though the system has been designed focusing on the pre production phase of the publishing process  benefits are also expected in other parts of the production and information chains   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to express our gratitude to the DiVA working group for undergraduate theses  especially to Markus Schneider  Ingela Tang and Peter Berkesand  for such thorough work with the survey and for their interesting input  Also  many thanks to Swedish BIBSAM as well as to Uppsala University for additional funding  Finally  our deep gratitude to our colleague at EPC  Erik Lindqvist  for working so patiently on the design and technical development of the system   5   </fulltext>
