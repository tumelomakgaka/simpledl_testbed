Supply and Demand Analysis in NDLTD Based on Patron Specialty Survey and Contents Statistics Seonho Kim  Seungwon Yang  and Edward A  Fox  shk  seungwon  fox vt edu  Digital Library Research Laboratory  Virginia Tech Blacksburg  VA 24061 USA  ABSTRACT There have been many efforts to investigate the use of ETDs  based on web log analysis  yielding information such as transferred data type  data size  file name  connection time  browser type  user s IP address  error code  etc  It is more difficult  however  to assess how well the contents of collections match the demands in each scholarly area  Since August 2005 we have been carrying out a user survey  as part of the registration process for our NDLTD search service providing clustered retrieval results  and 1 100 users  answers are available  Users are asked to enter their majors and detailed specialties  as well as the number of years they have worked in those areas  Through user modeling  building upon that data  we can measure the information demand for each user and area  To quantify the contents supply  we classify all the ETDs in the NDLTD union catalog into each scholarly area  based on the information provided by the authors  Then we analyze the diversity and proportions of the ETDs  and compare them with the corresponding user demands   1  INTRODUCTION The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD  union catalog  1  contains over 242 000 electronic theses  dissertations  ETDs  and important documents provided by more than 325 member institutions  such as libraries and universities  There were many studies to characterize and classify these ETDs and their access rates  However  there were no prior efforts to measure the information demands in NDLTD  In this paper  we put our focus on figuring out how well the contents of NDLTD match the demands of patrons in each scholarly area  Additionally  we analyze the patron distribution according to major fields  and expertise years in their fields  as well as the distribution of NDLTD resources  In Section 2 we describe the data set and preprocessing  In Section 3 we describe our approach to analyze data  difficulties we faced  and our method of measuring supply and demand in NDLTD  Section 4 gives details and charts about the results of our analysis  Section 5 presents conclusions  and Section 6 describes future work  2  DATA SET AND PREPROCESSING We used two different types of data sets  from three different sources  according to the purpose of analysis  One is ETD data for measuring information supply of NDLTD  and the other is user  1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7

this study is to understand how well the ETDs in NDLTD match with the information demands of users in each scholarly field  Our approach is based on classifying both the ETDs and user data into the same scholarly classes with the same criteria to see their distributions  Then we compare these two distributions with each other  This section explains our classification approaches for both ETDs and user data  3 1 Faculty Categories We created our own classification categories based on faculty college systems of universities  We considered five universities in Virginia  such as Virginia Tech  University of Virginia  George Mason University  Virginia Commonwealth University  and Virginia State University  7 categories and 77 subcategories were identified as listed in Table 2  Table 2  Seven Categories and Seventy Seven Subcategories 1 2 3  4  7 categories Architecture and Design Law Medicine  Nursing and Veterinary Medicine  Arts and Science  77 subcategories ArchitectureConstruction

subject  fields  see Figure 1   Likewise  classification of user data was done by examining the  major    broadresearch   and  specific  fields  see Figure 2   We will call these fields  which are used for classification   key fields   For classification of both ETD and user data  we built a common matching table that consisted of identification string patterns for each of the 77 subcategories  We checked the key fields  for inclusion of any pattern in the matching table  If any pattern in the table appears in the key fields  we classify the ETD or user data into the corresponding category  We created the matching table based on common knowledge  dictionary  and faculty college information from the universities listed in Section 3 1  Table 3 shows a portion of the matching table  Table 3

library    informatik            3 3 Challenges Our approach  classifying ETDs and user data based on searching for identification strings in key fields and classifying into the corresponding category  has several difficulties  as listed below  a  There are various expressions used in describing the same research subjects in the key fields  This is not only because there exist hundreds of research subjects  but also because people describe the same subject in slightly different ways  b  Various languages  such as English  Spanish  German  Portuguese  etc   are used for ETDs  c  There are many interdisciplinary subjects which can be classified into multiple categories  For example  should  Music Education  be classified into the  Music  class or the  Education  class  We classified these subjects to the class with the higher priority  In the case of this example   Music Education  was classified into the  Music  category  because there are many types of education  e g    Math Education  and  Computer Education   so the priority of  Education  is less than that of  Music   d  Many ETDs have no entry in the key fields   4   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  e  Key fields in some ETDs and user data contains wrong information  such as  Ph D    Georgia    gordd7 camu edu   etc   or typos  f  Some ETDs  key fields contain too much highly detailed information  that we couldn t understand  such as  muon    cytochrome    pulsars   etc   or unknown abbreviations  such as  MOCVD  and  OFDM   ETDs and user data corresponding to cases  d    e   and  f  above  as well as some for  a  and  b   were placed into the  Unclassifiable  class  3 4 Measuring Supply and Demand To measure the resource supply of NDLTD  we counted the number of ETDs in each scholarly category after classifying ETDs as described in previous sections  However  measuring user demand in each scholarly category is controversial  Does the number of users in a category represent well enough the user demand of the category  The numbers of users just tells us how users are distributed in NDLTD  Thus  we attempted to use actual indicators of information demand  based on numbers of queries  as represented by equation  1  below    number of queries  Demand of a Category     1   user  category  That is  the amount of information demand in a category is the sum of the number of queries sent by all users in the category   4  ANALYSIS OF SUMMARY STATISTICS 4 1 ETD Distribution We classified 242 688 ETDs into 77 subcategories as listed in Table 2  Because our classification method  described in Section 3 2  had too many ETDs in the  Unclassifiable  category  we followed the  correct and run over  approach  and kept updating the matching table until no ETDs with frequency greater than 9 were left  The final unclassifiable ETDs amounted to 40 17   About 90  of the unclassifiable ETDs have a unique  subject   which makes it hard to handle them one by one  Resource Distribution in NDLTD 2 1  3  4 8  1 2 3 4

electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  After classification into 77 subcategories  each subcategory was merged into one of the higher level 7 categories  Figure 3 shows the result  The numbers in this chart  and all other charts in this paper  correspond to the 7 categories listed in Table 2  We see that the  Arts and Science  4   and  Engineering and Applied Science  5   categories  if one ignores  Unclassifiable   are the most dominant areas among the 7 categories  4 2 User Distribution 1 100 users are classified into 77 subcategories based on their  major    broadresearch  and  specific  research fields  After then  77 subcategories are merged into higher 7 categories as we for the ETD classification discussed in Section 4 1  Figure 4 presents the result  Again  we had a  too many unclassifiable users  problem and reduced the number as we did in ETD classification  User Distribution in NDLTD  1  2 3  8  4  7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  5 6  Figure 4  Distribution of NDLTD Users From this chart  we can see that users are distributed similarly over all 7 categories except for the  Law  2   and  Medicine  Nursing and Veterinary Medicine  3   categories  4 3 Query Distribution Figuring out the query distribution in each scholarly category is done by adding up all frequencies of queries of all users in each category  as in equation  1   We regard these values as  demand  in NDLTD  Figure 5 gives the overall distribution of queries in NDLTD  Q uery Distribution in NDLTD 1 2 3 4  8  5  7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  6  Figure 5  Distribution of Queries in NDLTD  6   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  We can see users from  Arts and Science  4     Engineering and Applied Science  5    and  Business and Commerce  6   have requested similar amounts of information  From Figures 4 and 5  we see that although the numbers of users in  Architecture and Design  1   and  Education  6   fields are similar to other categories  they didn t use NDLTD actively  4 4 Supply Demand Comparison A Supply Demand comparison tells how well the supply of ETDs in NDLTD matches with user demands in each category  Figures 6 and 7 are results of comparisons in the 77 subcategories  These figures show that supply for  Business  and  Economics  is inadequate  relative to other fields  It is similar for several engineering areas  such as  Computer Science  and  Electronics   Figure 8 summarizes Figures 6 and 7 by merging subcategories into the higher level 7 categories  Supply Demand 77 Subcategories  1  2  12   ETD supply  User Demand  10  8  6  4  2   Fore stry Geo g ra ph y Geo lo gy tion

are generated after 1996 when the NDLTD project started  and have increased in number steadily  Also  it shows some ancient document are digitized and have been entered recently  As we examined these old date stamped records  most of these records are documents describing old pictures or materials  and the date stamps are the generation years of the old pictures or materials  not the document describing them  4 6 User Expertise Distribution We also analyzed the distribution of users  expertise years in their research areas and the amount of their demand  to investigate how many experienced users are using NDLTD  This is done by counting user data  which contains the answers to the user survey that asked their expertise years in their interest fields  Figure 10 shows the result  Because most users answered roughly  with simple numbers of years like 5  10  15  20  etc   the values of expertise years tend to converge on those numbers  Users  Expertise in Years 200 180 160  Users  140

IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  This result tells us that most NDLTD users have experience of between 1 to 10 years  which means that most of NDLTD users are graduate students or novice researchers  However  about 15  of all users have more than 10 years of experience in their fields  Figure 11 presents user experiences and their information demands in NDLTD  This tells how NDLTD is used actively for different levels of users  We can see most active users were graduate students with one year experience in their field  Expertise Years and Demand 25   Users  Demand  20   15   10   5   40  50 er ro r  35  39  30  28  26  27  24  25  22  23  20  21  19  17  18  15  16  13  14  11  12  9  10  8  7  6  4  5

of 242 688 ETDs and 1 100 users were classified into 7 categories and 77 subcategories using the same classification criteria  based on matching identification strings from  subject  fields in ETDs and  major    broadresearch   and  research  fields in user data  User demand in a category was measured by adding up query frequencies sent by all users in the category  From the comparison between supply and demand in NDLTD  we found the supply in the  Engineering and Applied Science  and  Business and Commerce  areas may be relatively insufficient  We also presented the date stamp distribution of ETDs to help in understanding of the age of the data in NDLTD  and users  expertise distribution and their amount of demand   to reveal the expertise level of major users   6  FUTURE WORK Classification of ETDs and users was the most important process in this study  however  our classification method showed a problem that left too much data  unclassifiable   In the future  we will add more user data and improve the precision of classification by using a popular text classification system  such as SVMLight  6   Using  oai etdms  metadata together with  oai dc  also would improve the classification  Currently  we use only query log information to measure the amount of information demand  however  we can improve this method by using additional user tracking information  Finally  our future work will include use of more advanced data mining techniques and visualization   10   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les
