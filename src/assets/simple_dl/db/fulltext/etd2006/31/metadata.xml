<fulltext>9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The Role of Penn State in Promoting Intellectual Property Rights through eTDs Naseem Saeed Sherwani The Pennsylvania State University 1  INTRODUCTION The publication of electronic theses and dissertations  eTDs  has gained a new currency in academic publishing  Submitting theses or dissertations as paper copies is gradually disappearing  Archived copies in university libraries have limited accessibility to readers  The Penn State University  1998   but theses or dissertations presented on the web are more widely available  But that is a mixed blessing  Soete  1998  has raised several concerns regarding Intellectual Property Rights  IPRs  including  ownership by the students and sponsorship by the university may seem to simplify the problems   There are some concerns that academic distribution channels or the peer review process can or could be circumvented  On the one hand  it seems a brilliant idea to place theses and dissertations on the web so that they are more widely available  On the other hand  the same idea may raise issues like plagiarism and the premature distribution of research material  Several publishers regard eTDs as previously published work  Soete  1998   Controversy swirls about eTDs  The goal of the paper is to review the efforts made at Penn State University to publish theses and dissertations through digital means  Though it is a work in process and the implementation of eTDs is not complete  this discussion will raise key questions and issues for investigation in electronic publication of theses and dissertations  In this paper  the researcher will identify the current situation of eTDs at Penn State using the Graduate School Data together with interviews of the key players in the implementation of eTDs and for promoting intellectual property rights  eTDs can open doors for academics  researchers  and practitioners to become partners in the Committee on Institutional Cooperation  CIC  universities  Joint efforts can develop a reservoir or repository of information from the scholarly contribution of students after they graduate from institutions of higher learning  These efforts can support students in achieving their career goals in a global and technologically advanced competitive market  2  DEFINITIONS 2 1  Intellectual Property Rights  IPRs  IPRs at Penn State are defined as   Managing  protecting  and licensing the intellectual property of faculty  graduate student  and staff at all Penn State locations  1 According to Wikipedia   IP is a broad entitlement extending the concept of property beyond its materialist definitions to include information  ideas  and other intangible assets in their expressed form  Depending on jurisdiction  IP rights generally enable the holder to exercise exclusive rights over the subject matter  or  work   of the IP using copyright  patent  trademark and similar legal protections  The term reinforces that such works are the product of the mind or intellect and that any rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of property   A leading international law organization named  The World Intellectual Property Organization  WIPO  defines that the word Intellectual Property in case of Copyright is applied to the creation in the fields of literature and arts with such work able to expressed as words  symbols  music  pictures  three dimensional objects  or combinations thereof  as in the case of an opera or a motion picture  2  1 2  See the IPR  http   www research psu edu ipo index html See the detail  http   www iploft com Nanotechnology pdf    2 2 2  ETDs The pioneer of eTDs was Virginia Tech University  which started eTDs for its students in January1997  According to a leading researcher of eTDs  George Soete   1998   ETDs are digitally produced  archived  and accessed theses and dissertations   Currently  there are 7956 number of eTDs and availability according to three options  5173 Unrestricted  2635 Restricted  and 146 Mixed  These eTDs can be accessed by authors and Department by visiting the website  3 An ETD  Electronic Thesis or Dissertation  is a digital document suitable for machine archives and worldwide access  It may incorporate such features as enhanced graphics  sound  and animation  In addition  eTDs enable users to perform comprehensive searches using words  phrases  or symbols  As of May 19  2006  there are 231 members  201 member universities  including 7 consortia   30 institutions belong to the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD   Kushokowski  2005  stated s that the Virginia Tech Library Website maintains extensive links to available eTDs including technical information for eTD authors  and links to other resources  p  3   2 3  Copyright Copyright is the legal protection of intellectual property  When an author creates an original work in the form of thesis or dissertation  the U S  law gives the rights of ownership under the Copyright Act of 1976  These rights protect the author of an electronic thesis or dissertation against infringement ownership rights to print  reprint  copy  sell and prepare derivative work on their own work 4 The thesis Office describes limitations on the authors  exclusive rights  Such as UMI has the right to sell copies of the theses and dissertations in and from microfilm or electronic format  According to Bastani and Fernandez   n d    Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea  By offering protection  copyright encourages the expression of original  artistic ideas into a tangible medium  Legal protection is affected instantly  when the original copyrightable subject matter is fixed into a tangible medium  e g  on paper or in a digital storage form   p 2   They explained the benefits of copyrights as more inexpensive and expediently obtained than the other types of protections such as patents  trade secrets  tradeworks  and trademarks  Copyrights are valid for the author s lifetime plus 50 years  A longer period of validity  75 100 years  applies if the creation was work made for hire  which is generally the case in the nanotechnology industry   Copyright is a set of exclusive rights granted by governments to regulate the use of a particular expression of an idea or information  At its most general  it is literally  the right to copy  an original creation  In most cases  these rights are of limited duration  The symbol for copyright is  c   and in some jurisdictions may alternately be written  c   Penn State has the right to make single copies of the theses and dissertations for nonprofit purposes  The author of an electronic thesis or dissertation is the copyright holder and owns the intellectual property of their eTDs  3  METHODOLOGY  3  4  DetailS can be seen on the website http   scholar lib vt edu theses browse by department    Within the United States  authors have rights protected by law particularly US Code  Title 17  especially section 106  Authors get to decide how their works will be reproduced  modified  distributed  performed in public and displayed in public  An author may use another s work with certain restrictions known as  fair use   US Code  Title 17  sect  107   The four factors of fair use that must be considered equally are   1  purpose and character of use   2  nature of the copyrighted work  amount and substantiality  and  4  effect  In the United States  libraries are also considered in the same copyright law under section 108    3 The Graduate school at Penn State has taken steps to implement eTD publishing in different phases so as to venture into this relatively unknown territory cautiously  This paper will be based on a two fold research process  Phase 1 The research paper has used Penn State s database to discover trends in eTDs among different colleges over the years  The research questions guiding this paper were as following  1  What is the current status of eTDs by semester at Penn State over the last five years  2  What is the current availability of eTDs by semester and college during Spring 2006  Phase 2 The researcher conducted interviews of eTD Committee members directly involved in implementing eTDs and the researcher also spoke with Faculty advisors and graduate student who have submitted and participated in the eTDs process  These open ended  exploratory interviews yielded insights into Penn State experience with eTDs  The two central questions that guided the interviews were as follows  1  How did these individuals work to make the introduction of eTDs a successful effort  2  What challenges have they faced  and are they facing  in this process  The interview results were analyzed using a qualitative approach  4  BACKGROUND The Penn State eTD program began as a pilot in the fall of 1998 with doctoral dissertations only  Since its inception  over one thousand dissertations have been submitted and posted on line  The Penn State eTD program joined NDLTD sometimes in 2000 when the eTD program was made available to all doctoral candidates 5 The key administrative players in the process of the eTDs  implementation are the Penn State Graduate School  the University Libraries  and the Graduate Faculty  Moreover  graduate students conduct research and create the scholarly writing  The thesis office  a division of Graduate Enrollment Services  is the branch of graduate school at Penn State has started accepting dissertations on line  One of the female active members who has 5 10 years of working experience in the field of eTD mentioned  the importance of the collaborative efforts between the different University departments  She noted   The Graduate School Thesis Office is responsible for the regulating submission specs  certifying theses  and handling receipt of theses and paper work for publishing  Penn State s ITS offers workshops on using the thesis software and eTD production  The university library is responsible for cataloguing  preserving  and providing access to the thesis after the thesis has been accepted  approved and the candidate has graduated  The Libraries Computing Services mounts and archives the eTDs   In case of electronic publishing  the eTDs will be uploaded to ProQuest UMI after the date  the degree is conferred to the student if no restriction involved  4 1 1  Current Status Currently  graduate students are submitting their theses and dissertations on line  Figure 1 shows the trend of eTD submission in last five years have persistently increased  In 2005  the number of eTD submission was the highest  a total of 403 eTDs were submitted during that year  To date  eTD has received over 1 000 submissions   5  More information about the program is

including the option of restricting the access to the campus community for a period of two years  or denying access altogether for a period of two years for patent and or proprietary purposes  After two years unless a written request is received for extension  the work will be released automatically for access to worldwide  The electronic theses and dissertations  eTDs  has been available to doctoral candidates at Penn State since the fall semester 2000  About 70  of doctoral students are submitting electronically by choice  However  this is not mandatory for masters level students at this point  However  the full on line submission of dissertations will be mandatory by the fall 2006 for the doctoral candidates   16  Worldwide PSU only 34  Restricted 71  Figure 2  Penn State ETD

submit their dissertations on line  they must be properly trained  and have access to software  training  technical assistance  and properly equipped computer labs  Additionally  students must be familiar with the technology in order to more creative in their scholarly communication  and must understand the importance of protecting intellectual property rights  In order to achieve the goal of full implementation of the eTD initiative  Information Technology Services  ITS  has provided full support  In addition to classroom training  ITS has provided free access to software to graduate students via their website  The Penn State software package called PsuThesi for Word is a collection of Microsoft Word templates containing interactive tools to produce a Penn State Scholars  paper according to the guidelines set forth by the Thesis Office  Versions of the software are available for both Windows and Macintosh operating systems  Since 2004  ITS has also offered two seminars related to this eTD software   PsuThesi  Thesis Templates for Microsoft Word  and  Adobe Acrobat   Interestingly  students  attendance is relatively higher in Fall and Spring semesters  and attendance in the PSU thesis seminar is higher than attendance in the Adobe Acrobat seminar  The graduate school has provided a wider dissemination of PsuThesi software among the graduate students    6 50 45  43

in College of Education also conducts seminars to train the graduate students in the production of eTDs  4 2 2  eTDs Format The graduate school accepts the eTDs in the form of PDF  multimedia files 6 It is important to note that the  final copy  of thesis is electronic one submitted to graduate office  and is archived in the university libraries  L  S  Kellerman talked about storage of electronic dissertations at Penn State the electronic dissertations are being stored as PDF files  Other formats might be used in the future  In addition to UMI  LCS provides the server and database to serve the eTDs to the world via the web  The database is regularly backed up to tape  No CDs  She cites B  MacEwan Personal Communication  November 16  2000    We have made a national level commitment to archive these  dissertations  I assume we are comfortable with the plan for archiving and migration and there is no confusion about whether or not we need to retain this information permanently   Personal Communication  May 22  2006   5  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 5 1 1  Intellectual Property Institutional set up Penn State has earned its name among the leading research universities in the United States  According to official source  its  total research budget is in excess of  638 million  This allocation aims to enhance research activities that generate volumes of information  This research is published in the dissertations  reports  presentations  and in the other formats such as the popular Research Penn State Magazine  Discoveries and inventions with commercial potential  however  are protected prior to public disclosure  These  including patents  trademarks  copyrights  and know how  are Penn State Intellectual Property  Penn State has well established Intellectual Property Office  IPO   The intellectual Property Office is a unit of the Research and Technology Transfer Organization under the Vice President for Research  7 6 7  The site for file formats that can be used for images and multimedia  http   www cac psu edu etd howto graphics  For further information  http   www research psu edu ipo index html   7 5 1 2  Copyright and UMI The author of an electronic thesis or dissertation is the copyright holder and owns the intellectual property of their ETD  Penn State has the right to make single copies of the thesis and dissertation for nonprofit purposes  Every doctoral candidate must submit to the Thesis Office a signed UMI Doctoral Dissertation Agreement for granting ProQuest UMI the right to reproduce and distribute the work  in whole or in part  in and from microfilm or electronic format  This agreement does not interfere with the author s rights as copyright holder  By signing this agreement  the UMI is liable to take action in case of any damage occurs due to copyright violation  In this fast learning academic environment  students need to be familiar with the rules of  copyright that govern how intellectual property is legally protected 8 5 1 3  Terms and or conditions to protect intellectual property rights and copyright issues From the point of view of a copy right expert   Intellectual property rights of dissertation will depend upon agreement within College  and between student and advisor  If discovery is made during research process  PSU may retain intellectual property rights to any patentable discovery  This would depend upon policy  funding of research  etc  This would also determine level of access provided to dissertation during the initial years after graduation   She explains further   Dissertations themselves are accessible in three ways  open  PSU only  or unavailable  Student makes access determination at time of submission  After a certain number of years  all dissertations will be made openly available  Responsibility for protecting copyright of third party materials within dissertation lies with student  Graduate School and libraries would need to be notified if permission to use such materials in an eTD has not been cleared  so it can be removed prior to posting   An active eTD member mentioned that  Copy right of content remains with the author   A doctoral student mentioned that   I submitted a copyright permission letter for my published chapters from the publishers that own the copyright and noted such in the preface and chapter footnotes  They were required   One of the ITS instructors with three years of experience mentioned that library provides a host to meet the costs  An active eTD member says that doctoral candidates pre pay the cost for processing eTDs  The eTD cost is  70 compared to the paper print dissertation processing of  85  5 2 1  Publication One of the major concerns for many graduate students is to get acceptance from publishers of their electronic research work in the form of books and or articles in Journals  The interview conducted at Penn State Press gave important insight in this perspective  The question of publisher who has been asked to consider putting out the revised dissertation in book forms  It is going to ask the whole word has already seen your dissertation  So what is the value of putting out in print book spending asking us to spend 20 to30  000 dollars to put your book as the print forms  You know 90  of it has already been available that is a really tough question  Early on  there were a lot of mixed responses from both journals and book publishers about how they were to be reacted  Some journals publishers consider that this would be considered the equivalent of the regular publication  They would not accept submissions that were already been broadcast the world in this way  5 2 2  Patentability The question about the effects of patentability of ideas has become sensitive  This has become disadvantageous for graduate student to get published their electronic submissions  One of the interviewee suggested that  the dissertations in particular those fields in which patents are very important  They were advised not to allow wider access outside the university and sometimes not even within the university  Once the idea becomes published in that way  you lose the opportunity to patent    8  For more information on creating eTDs for publishing  Visit this website  http   etd psu edu publish html   8 S  After eTDs  the libraries are considering to change their decisions not to buy the books which have already been published on line  One of the interviewed opined   We have to know how they are thinking about and what they are buying in order to figure out  what specific for us to publish  We do not want to put a lot of our resources in to publishing the books they are not going to buy  Because they think that they are buying the same thing twice  Students  their faculty advisors  and committees must be aware of the publication practices in their respective fields  While many publishers feel that thesis dissertation dissemination via an eTDs Digital Library does not constitute prior publication  some publishers will not accept works that have been made available through the Penn State Digital Library  Other publishers will not allow material that has been published in their journals to be disseminated an eTDs via an eTDs digital library   Therefore  the journal book publication based upon the respective thesis or dissertation will most likely be very different than what is contained in master thesis or doctoral dissertation  This difference can be the deciding factor in what a publisher and or editor will publish  However  it is the student s responsibility to seek input from publishers regarding publication policies  Penn State has published the eTDs in the form of books keeping in view that there is new enough in the book to make the dissertation worth publishing  Penn State publishes revised dissertations but certainly  a lot more careful about which one to publish that make initial exchange of information a difference between the two as a part of the process  If the authors have gone up to a certain point and the book will carry the story forward for another decade in the world  It also has value above and beyond dissertation and value of substance  it is not the matter of style  6  ETD MILESTONES AND FUTURE GROWTH In order to get insight into the experience of key players to protect intellectual property rights through the eTDs Initiative  the respondents reported their thoughts about the efforts and the challenges of implementing eTDs  6 1 1  Achievements There are interesting findings with the full implementation of eTD submissions  From faculty point of view the eTD submissions will help to achieve wider dissemination of dissertations  save space  save money and enhance creativity  R  S  Albitz described enthusiastically   for the libraries eTDs save space  enhance services  and provide access to other researchers   For libraries  this process saves  money as related to staff time  managing the print binding of theses  UMI is still microfilming for preservation purposes    Personal Communication  May 17  2006  Moreover  an active committee member  S  Thatcher  suggested several overarching goals   One of the goals is simply for the students is learning experience going through and creating and getting familiar of working with electronic documents  So It was partly expansion of their own educational experience because as they go on and become scholars in their fields and pursue other things  They have to deal with electronic documents a lot  So it is good idea for them to get to know at this stage and get to being comfortable with feeling the environment and certainly wider dissemination has always been the goals of the libraries to increase the utilities of these dissertations to provide a way to access more  and cited more in their research and certainly save space   He further stated   eTDs is just exchanging from one set of cross to another technology cross  You have to keep up the technology aspect  So the cost is just equal to the cost of printing   He thinks that  it does not save any money   Personal Communication  April 21  2006   6 1 2  Advantages The faculty members aged more than 50 years have more than twenty years of experience argued that on line publication will enhance accessibility and reduce the costs involved in it  A doctoral student aged 30 years   9 stated advantage   easy to fix last minute errors  save paper  wider dissemination  As compared to paper copy  it was cheaper   Librarian s point of view   Advantages is broad dissemination  space and staff dollar savings  S  Thatcher described   From the authors point of view it is obviously advantageous to have their work accessible and especially through Networked Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD  where subject key words searches and everything enable the people to find out about their work and be able people to access and use it around the whole world  That would help them become known for their work in their specific field  In terms of viewers  promoting and publicizing about their original own research has been  It is a great value to do it in this way   Personal Communication  April 21  2006  George Soete  He mentions several benefits of eTDS in his research  These are accessible from anywhere at anytime  The processing of eTDs takes less time for wider availability  The education of students in use of electronic technologies can help to enhance the quality of their publications by including multi media files  From libraries point of view  potential savings 6 1 3  Disadvantages Disadvantages include issues about access and republication Elsevier and others beginning to allow eTD content to be submitted for journal publication   Kellerman   Mugridge  2002  expressed their concerns for the long term preservation of eTDs such as that Electronic submissions may be in using eXtensible Markup Language  XML   XM is a tagged ASCII text that can be interpreted by non proprietary  browser  for maximum readability  They suggested that student needs to be trained to submit their dissertations in various forms such as Word document and or a PDF  According to P  Leathers that multimedia files using audios  videos  images are compressed and embedded into PDF files before final submission to Thesis Office   Personal Communication  May 22  2006   One of the limitations of the Penn State eTD process is that UMI  the distributor of eTDs  only distributes eTDs in black and white  Furthermore  there are not guidelines related to color in eTDs production  Therefore  different departments have been hesitant to participate in the eTDs submissions  During summer 2005  110 paper dissertations were examined  S  Kellerman pointed out that there are no guidelines related to colors according to PSU Thesis guidelines  She stated that color is one of the advantages to eTDs  The use of colors is essential for understanding the contents of their scholarly work  Therefore  the departments like engineering  architecture  arts were reluctant for their online submissions  Personal Communication  May 22  2006   While a graduate student mentioned the disadvantages of eTD   No shiny hardcover book in the library  need to understand formatting software and own PDF printing software  some are free  but not the good ones     Personal Communication  May 16  2006   6 2 1  eTDs  implications for Future The foregoing discussion may lead us to draw some cautious conclusions  There is no doubt that eTDs have gained popularity in higher educational institutions  in general  The main goal is to unlock the potential of intellectual property and copy rights of graduate students  As we are well aware  the current generation is more receptive to participate in it due to familiarity with the new technologies  The utilization of these skills make the graduate students more creative and to be known in their areas of research  They are more inclined to participate in on line publishing of their scholarly work on the web  It is important to bear in mind the goal behind eTDs initiative is the protection of intellectual property rights associated with research performed by the graduate student at Penn State University  Copyright as the legal protection of intellectual Property right gives ownership of authorship  All eTDs have an abstract available for world wide access  but students have choices on on line availability  such as a  Worldwide  b  PSU only and c  Restricted  The eTDs initiative will bring about respect  recognition and protection to researchers for their knowledge sharing  The Thesis Office  Information Technology Services and The Intellectual Property Right offices at Penn State are pursuing their mission to provide graduate students the necessary information regarding the use of copyright materials  training of eTDs software  and the necessary procedures involved in the dissertation process before final submissions    10 References Bastani  B    Fernandez  D   n d    Intellectual property rights in nanotechnology  Retrieved May 22  2006  from http   www iploft com
