ABSTRACT Typical digital library system does not help much to get instantly online a full text of the multimedia document and other services related to processing of the retrieved document  This is the main reason why the Lithuanian Science and Studies Electronic Documents Digital Library  eLABa  project is currently being implemented  Almost all libraries hosted by Lithuanian academic institutions take part in the project  In parallel  the pilot Lithuanian ETD project funded by UNESCO has enabled to set up the repository of Lithuanian ETDs  Consequently  the main purpose of this paper is to present how the ETD repository is going to be redeveloped and integrated into eLABa  The Fedora 2 1 software and complementary VTLS product VALET for ETDs has been chosen to create an experimental Lithuanian ETD library as part of the eLABa  In particular  the advantages and drawbacks of using Fedora 2 1 based repository along with the VTLS will be discussed  In general  ETD repository serves as a good model for creation of the eLABa digital library   Keywords  ETD  metadata  e publishing  repository  digital library  1  INTRODUCTION Lithuanian Academic Libraries Network  LABT  2006  cleared the way for creation of the Lithuanian Virtual Library with unified access to digital resources as well as to the other typical library services  The conceptual LABT model has been developed  Kuciukas  2004  taking into account many factors including both advancements in information technology and increased needs of users  In accordance with the conceptual model the electronic library of Master s theses  Doctor s dissertations and their summaries  Streimikis  2005  has been developed  For that the VTech ETD software system was  adapted and  used  The realization of the Lithuanian ETD library made it possible firstly to experiment and to test in practice the fundamental principles of the conceptual model  and secondly to extend considerably the research and development activities in creation of Lithuanian Electronic Academic Library  eLABa   The eLABa is viewed as databases of full text publications distributed across the network of academic libraries and  importantly  includes necessary e publication facilities and services  Three projects supported by European Union Structural Funds  ES SF  currently are set up aiming at creation of the academic e publishing system    The paper describes briefly the overall goals of the eLABa  presents the collections of e documents supposed to be stored in the library  on the ground of Lithuanian ETD deployment discusses strengths and weaknesses of VTLS software VALET for ETDs  especially from the perspective of integration with database management system Fedora  which was chosen as a base platform for eLABa repository  The main goal LABT project is to create the Lithuanian Virtual Library through the automation of academic libraries  unification of search and access to electronic  hereinafter   e  information sources and virtual services  In 2002 2004 considering the latest trends in information technology and the increased needs of users the conceptual LABT model  Kuciukas  2004  providing the conception of Lithuanian Virtual Library has been prepared  Following this conception in 2003 2004 the electronic library of Master s theses  Doctor s dissertations and their summaries  Streimikis  2005  based on the adapted VTech ETD software has been created  Lithuanian ETD library allowed checking in practice the fundamental principles of the suggested general model for Lithuanian academic e publishing  fulltext databases and Lithuanian Virtual Library  Three projects related to the academic e publishing   The creation of Lithuanian electronic publishing system    Lithuanian science and study e documents storage and presentation to the users  and  Lithuanian virtual library development and creation of full text database repository   financed by ES SF being implemented in 2005 2008 is the natural outcome of the LABT project which has been carried out within eight years  On the basis of LABT and above mentioned three projects financed by ES SF the Lithuanian information system of science and studies electronic documents was started to be developed  Actually this system is being created as Lithuanian Electronic Academic Library  eLABa  functioning as a national digital library  Fedora software has been chosen as the base of eLABa repository  The goal of eLABa  the collections of e documents supposed to be stored  the usage possibilities  advantages and problems of VTLS software VALET for ETDs  operating with Fedora met in the process of integration of Lithuanian ETD library into eLABa are discussed in the article   2  GOALS The goal of eLABa is to create the environment and means and using them to prepare  collect and store for a long period of time Lithuanian science and studies electronic documents grouped into various collections and to deliver them to the internet users in different outputs  thus providing the background for the formation of Lithuanian Electronic Academic Library  The main functions of eLABa    submission of science and studies publications into eLABa using Lithuanian e publishing process workflow models    gathering  filing  accumulation and long term preservation of science and studies electronic documents    information search and the direct and constant access to the science and studies documents stored in eLABa under the conditions set by authors or copyright subjects for the employees and students of Lithuanian science and studies institutions  and other users    submission of data about the electronic documents of science and studies to NDLTD  Google and other information search systems  The eLABa project is aiming at making a favorable conditions for faster dissemination of up to date knowledge and material for studies by using information and communication technologies  to improve the quality of science research and studies  to develop distance learning and whole life education  to preach activities and achievements of Lithuanian scientists and science and studies institutions  to educate and develop knowledge society   2   3  COLLECTIONS OF E DOCUMENTS Classification of the resources according to the documents types  books  journals  ETDs  etc   facilitates access and retrieval of knowledge and material for studies more effectively  At the first stage  starting from 2006  five collections of e documents are planned to be accumulated in eLABa  The Collection of Books  Science  educational and information publications  books   for example  monographs  collections of articles  course books  educational books  learning books  task books  learning programs  summaries  reference books  dictionaries  albums  encyclopedias of various themes published by Lithuanian publishers are assigned to the collection of books  The search for a book can be performed using search indexes such as author  title  name   ISBN  publisher  place and year of publication and etc  The search of contents can be carried out using key words  terms or words from contents of the book  annotations and summaries   All books are grouped to thematic categories  The Collection of Journals and Articles  The scientific journals of Lithuania and the articles of scientists of Lithuania published in various foreign scientific journals are assigned to the collection of journals and articles  The necessary journal can be searched according title  ISSN  publisher and etc  Articles can be found browsing the numbers of chosen journals or searching using the key words  author of the article  title  terms or words published in the summary of the article   Journals and articles are grouped to thematic categories according the branches and trends of science  The Collection of Scientific Reports  The reports of contracted scientific research carried out in Lithuania are assigned to the Collection of Scientific Reports  Scientific reports are grouped agreeably to the thematic categories  The scientific reports can be found by title  by name of scientific coordinator  by the institution name  by registration number  place and year of publication  etc  The search of contents can be carried out using keywords  terms or words which are published in the summary of scientific research   The Collection of Events  The papers  the handout of the papers  the presentations of the papers of conferences  seminars  congresses and other events held in Lithuania  and the papers of Lithuanian scientists published in publications of international conferences are assigned to the Collection of Events  The necessary publication of event papers can be searched according event name  the title of publication of event papers  ISSN  ISBN  publisher  place  year of publication and etc  The papers of event one can find browsing the publications of chosen conferences or searching using key words  author of the paper  title  terms  or words published in the summary of the paper   The papers of the events are grouped according to thematic categories  The Collection of ETD  Theses  their summaries and master s works defended for a degree in institutions of science and education of Lithuania are submitted to ETD collection  The necessary theses  their summary or master s work can be searched according author  title  name   institution granting a degree  supervisor  place year of publication and etc  The search of contents can be carried out using key words  Theses  summaries and master s works are grouped to thematic categories according the branches and trends of science  Collection of ETD  Collection of books  Collection of journals  Collection of scientific reports and Collection of events are open for all users  Full texts of e documents of these Collections are usually presented in PDF but it can be also presented in other formats  for example XML  In the near future eLABa is supposed to be supplemented with other collections of e documents such as a collection of music compositions  a collection of empirical data  etc  In the next sections the eLABa component for the formation of ETD collection  eLABa ETD  is described in more detail   3   4  ABOUT eLABa ETD With the intention of specifying more clearly the eLABa ETD component  which is being developed it would be reasonable to specify its modular structure and possibilities of using VALET for ETDs for the development of this component  Experimentally identified functional and technical limitations of VALET for ETDs interfering the development of eLABa ETD component are disclosed and recommendations for the elimination of these limitations are given   4 1  The Modular Structure of the eLABa ETD Three layers can be highlighted in the modular structure of the eLABa ETD  Frontend layer  Integration layer and Plugable layer  Picture 1   4 1 1  Frontend Layer Modules Submission module is intended for the submission of theses  dissertations and their summaries  hereinafter   ETD  to eLABa repositories  This module is being used by postgraduates and doctorate students  hereinafter   students   Using submission module it is possible to submit the whole ETD or its metadata  Also by using this module the primary verification of metadata is performed  Review module is intended for revising  reviewing  validating  approval and submission of ETD and its metadata to eLABa repositories if no mistakes are found  Reviewing is carried out step by step in several stages and if needed by coming back to the previous stages  After the reviewing is finished ETD and its metadata are submitted to eLABa repositories  This module guarantees the connection between a reviewer and a student submitting his her ETD for example by using e messages  A reviewer and a student intercommunicate using this module in order to correct as operatively as possible the mistakes that have emerged in ETD or in its metadata   Picture 1 The Modular Scheme of eLABa Being Developed  4   Reports module is intended for generating the various reports about ETD stored and submitted to eLABa and for accumulating all required statistical information such as the types of the submitted ETD  their limitations  etc  Import module is intended for the processing of specially prepared ETD by selecting metadata from ETD according to the corresponding template automatically  and later verifying and transferring them to the review module for processing  Visualization module is intended for the correct visualization of ETD stored in eLABa repositories in different sections  The module must ensure not only the visualization of the stored ETD in different eformats that meet the requirements of the users but also must provide the possibility to navigate through the tree of document structure for example through sections  paragraphs  etc  Administration module is intended for user administration functions such as assignment of rights to a particular user or to the group of users  users list management  etc  used for the administration of the main eLABa ETD users  students  reviewers and other users  and their groups  so called CRUD   Create  Retrieve  Update  Delete functions  Configuration module is intended for the description of various eLABa ETD interfaces and for configuring its system parameters  For example the interface for submission and reviewing Master s theses should differ from the interface for submission and reviewing Doctor s dissertation  It is reasonable to design different system interfaces for different institutions  their faculties  etc  Using this module system eLABa ETD parameters should also be configured for example various registers with different values depending on the configured interface  Content management module is intended for revision and administration  CRUD functions  of both ETD metadata submitted to eLABa repositories and administrative data  also for the export of ETD and their metadata in various formats such as XML  PDF  PS  etc  4 1 2  Integration Layer Modules Authentication Authorization module is intended for user authentication according to its identity for example by its name or unique student card ID and password  also to identify if the user is authorized to use one or another hardware and software resources  This module is common for both students submitting their works and reviewers and may be integrated with different external systems such as LDAP  IMAP  Active Directory  etc  Very important function of this module would be to create and assign access rules  ACL   Access Control List  to e documents to be stored into eLABa repository following by author copyright license  Storage module is intended to perform and manage the temporary and long term preservation of ETD and accompanying metadata in various repositories  After choosing a proper control mechanism this module must secure the possibility to operate not only with Fedora but also with other repositories such as DSpace  Greenstone and others if needed  thus ensuring independence from a particular repository  Metadata module is intended for the collection of data related to ETD from information systems  such as PeopleSoft TM  of various institutions as well as library systems  thus reducing the number of mistakes of metadata formation and speeding up the ETD submission process  The data gathered during this process are sent through the submission module to a student  who reviews  corrects  supplements them and approves their correctness  This module is used to transform the ETD related data submitted to eLABa repositories into MARC bibliographic records  to load them into Lithuanian ETD union catalogue and or into library systems  such as Aleph 500 TM  of institutions by indexing them  Important functionality of this module   ability of automatic metadata format transformations such as DC  MARC21  UNIMARC  etc   5   OAI PMH module must enable other external harvesting systems  such as OAICat  which forms NDLTD union catalogue to take ETD metadata in OAI MPH protocol  In such a way the search of ETD according to various search criteria such as author  work title  year of creation  topic  etc  is ensured for external search systems  Such search may be performed through the portals of library systems of institutions  through the portal of Lithuanian Virtual Library and other systems such as NDLTD  OAIster  Google and other portals   4 1 3  Plugable Modules Layer This layer is used to ensure the connection of eLABa ETD with the external institutional systems for example with user databases  LDAP server   e mail systems  Mail Server   repositories  Fedora  DSpace  Greenstone   database management systems  ORACLE  Versant   library and other systems related to the search of e resources  ALEPH  MetaLib  SFX   This may be guaranteed by creating the corresponding interfaces used in the integration layer and developing new so called switching modules  For each separately used external realisation of the system the separate switching module hiding the external system from eLABa LTD is required   4 2  Functional and Technical Limitations of VALET for ETDs While planning and implementing eLABa ETD  which main modules are described in the section 4 1  it has been decided to examine in depth the possibilities allowing the integration of VTLS company s product  VALET for ETDs  into eLABa ETD  After carrying out the experimental research the functional and technical limitations interfering the integration of VALET for ETDs into eLABa ETD were identified and the ways to eliminate the limitations were found  4 2 1  Functional and Technical Limitations of VALET for ETDs and Ways for their Elimination Security and authentication authorization  VALET for ETDs allows integrating the different authentication systems such as IMAP  LDAP  MS  Active Directory and others  However actually it performs only the function of user identification  i e  authentication function  which uses only the one selected authentication system and do not have the possibility of managing user groups and rights  Also VALET for ETDs have no possibilities which could facilitate the import of users  authentication authorization data from external systems  For example there is no possibility to import student s name  surname  faculty  etc  automatically from LDAP servers of Lithuanian institutions participating in ETD project  hereinafter   institutions  into VALET for ETDs  Seeking to secure the listed lacking possibilities  a new authentication authorization module described in the paragraph 4 1 2 is recommended to be developed  VALET for ETDs program code would be enhanced in a way to give possibility of user and users group access to repository resources authorization using ACL  SSO  Single Sign On  functionality would be added to VALET for ETDs to give possibility central user authentication and authorization systems as to be used by group of software systems  eLABa  ALEPH  MetaLib  etc  The import of metadata from external IS  Many of institutions have their own information systems  IS  where additional ETD metadata such as information about ETD supervisors  dissertation defence commissions  reviewers  etc  are stored  The mentioned information is also stored in Lithuanian science and studies information system  LieMSIS  which is being implemented now in all Lithuanian science and studies institutions  On purpose to avoid routine work and to reduce the probability of mistakes entering the additional metadata it is reasonable to import this information automatically from LieMSIS and institutional IS   6   But VALET for ETDs has no possibility to integrate external IS and cannot import ETD related into any widely used format such as plain text  MS Word  Excel  Therefore it is recommended to enhance Submission module of VALET for ETDs with new functions which would enable to obtain the needed newest additional data from the corresponding institutional IS during the process of ETD submission  The new functions are recommended to be implemented in such a way that they could be easy adapted for new institutional IS  Postgraduate theses by several authors  In many of Lithuanian universities it is practised that one Master s thesis can be written not by one but by two or three postgraduates  But according to the logic of VALET for ETDs the ETD prepared by only one author can be submitted to the repository  Therefore Submission module and Review module of VALET for ETDs are recommended to be supplemented with new features which would allow entering new metadata describing ETD  for example co authors  Reports  The essential constituent of a modern IS is the formation of various reports  Therefore for creation of ETD collection the possibility to form reports according to various features for example according to ETD types  users  institutions  etc  is essential  However VALET for ETDs does not have the possibility of forming reports  In order to guarantee the possibility of eLABa ETD reports  a new Reports module described in the paragraph 4 1 1  is recommended to be developed  Configuring  The practice has shown that the architecture of VALET for ETDs based on so called logical units of base configuration  called View   does not allow easy making of many required changes in configuration system for example forming a new submission and reviewing environments  setting a few languages in the submission interface  etc  In order to guarantee the flexible configuring the architecture of VALET for ETDs is recommended it to be basically improved as nonessential changes are not sufficient  For example in order to install multilingual feature in VALET for ETDs operating in one View  the essential changes must be carried out in many modules applying them to the classificators and templates of different languages which could be easily and promptly interchanged  Administration  VALET for ETDs does not have an administration module which simplifies the administration of the system  Therefore VALET for ETDs can be administered only using configuration files  The practice has shown that such administration of VALET for ETDs is inconvenient and inefficient  Seeking to guarantee a convenient eLABa ETD administration  a new User administration module described in the paragraph 4 1 2  is recommended to be developed  4 2 2  Technical Limitations Perfection  The current version of VALET for ETDs only partly meets the needs of eLABa ETD Submission  Review and Storage modules  The main disadvantages of these modules are described in the paragraph 4 2 1  The practice has shown that if Submission  Review and Storage modules are improved and integrated with the needed new Authentication authorization  Reports  Import and Metadata gathering modules  in principle VALET for ETDs could be used for the development of eLABa ETD  Architecture  VALET for ETDs is professionally developed  But the chosen architecture does not ensure an easy appliance of VALET for ETDs to the specific needs  It s modules directly depend on each other  Changes in one module require changes in other modules  The flexible possibility of integrating other external systems  except User Authentication  to VALET for ETDs are not foreseen   7   Therefore it is reasonable to make essential architectural changes in the newer versions of VALET for ETDs following the established principles of OSA  Open System Architecture   Effectiveness  VALET for ETDs runs under CGI  http   hoohoo ncsa uiuc edu cgi    This is an outdated WEB application interface  Running such application a separate process is created for each query by using additional technical and time resources  Also CGI interface is inapplicable in case the number of parallel user queries is high  Therefore WEB application interface is not so effective as Java2EE  http   java sun com javaee   application servers for example  There are no popular Perl application servers at present  Therefore seeking for better effectiveness  VALET for ETDs should be developed in another language such as JAVA and this requires too much time and other resources  Therefore the effectiveness of VALET for ETDs is recommended to be increased by using Apache WEB Server extensions such as mod perl for example  Migration  Although VALET for ETDs has been developed using Perl programming language due to some specific limitations used for the management of UNIX command files for example  it runs only under UNIX environment  Thus the transfer of VALET for ETDs into MS Windows environment would be rather complicated  Therefore in new VALET for ETDs versions the migration problem is recommended to be solved  Maintaining and development  Perl programming language used to develop VALET for ETDs is rather hardly readable  Therefore it is reasonable to improve VALET for ETDs modules as little as possible  Seeking to implement the required features which are lacking in VALET for ETDs  new independent modules are recommended to be developed  It is purposeful for VALET for ETDs to have external interfaces  e g based on SOAP REST   enabling to enhance change its functionality by using other systems  Later it is recommended to integrate the improved VALET for ETDs and newly developed modules into a separate component  The component formed in such a way could be easily updated in the future for example by replacing the current VALET for ETDs with a new version  Such principle of a separate component is applied in the development of eLABa ETD  Documentation  VALET for ETDs is poorly documented  Therefore it is recommended to complement VALET for ETDs documentation substantially   5  CONCLUSIONS In 2005 2008 on the basis of LABT and three projects financed by ES SF the Lithuanian Information System of Science And Studies Electronic Documents was started to be developed  Actually this system is being created as Lithuanian Electronic Academic Library  eLABA  functioning as a national digital library  As the base for eLABa repository Fedora software has been chosen  At the first stage five collections of e documents  including ETD collection  are planned to be accumulated in eLABa repositories  After analyzing the needs of eLABa ETD component its modular scheme has been prepared and functional requirements of modules have been formed  Seeking to reduce the realization costs it was decided to use open source systems  OSS   Currently most popular OSS for the formation of ETD collection is VALET for ETDs software  which can be integrated with Fedora  Therefore the architecture and functional possibilities of the VALET for ETDs have been analyzed in more detail  The practice has shown that current features of VALET for ETDs are insufficient for the creation of the needed eLABa ETD component  VALET for ETDs only partly meets functional requirements of three  Submission  Review and Storage  modules from twelve described in the article  Therefore VALET for ETDs must be substantially improved in order to integrate it into eLABa  For the formation of the aimed eLABa ETD component it is reasonable to improve all modules of VALET for ETDs and to develop new independent modules which would realize the required  8   possibilities  For the development of new modules it is reasonable to choose such architecture  which would secure their operation irrespective of VALET for ETDs version  It would allow changing VALET for ETDs with a new VALET for ETDs version or with entirely another system meeting better eLABa ETD needs  After making the first tests with eLABa ETD prototype developed on the base of VALET for ETDs it has been determined that this prototype could be started to be applied for the submission of ETD and their metadata to eLABa repositories  It would be reasonable to continue the development of this prototype with a perspective to create the aimed eLABa ETD component which would secure all its functions required   6  REFERENCES Kuciukas  V   Abramcikiene  R   Butkeviciene  B   Duobiniene  G   Jauckojis  J   Jurgutis  et al   2004   Feasibility study of the Lithuanian academic e publishing
