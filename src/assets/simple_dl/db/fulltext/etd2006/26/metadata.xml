<fulltext>9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  GETTING TO KNOW THE CONTENTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES OF ETDs  Ana M B Pavani apavani lambda ele puc rio br Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  Abstract ETDs contain precious information   state of the art bibliographic reviews  Graduate students starting their research can browse the references and learn about important works in their areas of interest  At the same time  references can be viewed from a different stand point   as holders of information on       Relations there exist among ETDs and other works of their authors  their advisors and other faculty  Types of works and languages they are written in  Different profiles of types of works and languages among the disciplines  Evolution of types and languages as time goes by  in general and for different disciplines   This addresses the first part of a project in progress focusing the contents of references in ETDs  The project has the objectives of   1  Identifying ETDs that are references in ETDs and trying to establish a measure analogous to the impact factor   2  Mapping endogeny in graduate programs   3  Analyzing the evolution of reference types from traditional  paper  to online works  In order to fulfill the objectives  a set of tools was developed  They are devoted to ETDs and not to theses   dissertations in general because they are applied to digital files  the reason is operational   Keywords  ETD  bibliographic references  impact factor  bibliographies 1  INTRODUCTION Garfield  2005  states that he introduced the idea of an impact factor in an article he published in 1955  Garfield 1955   Later  in the 1960s the journal impact factor was created to evaluate  compare and select journals  In the five decades from this first article  the impact factor has been used and also  according to the creator  Garfield 1955   has  become so controversial  Like nuclear energy  the impact factor is a mixed blessing   At the same time  it is an index that is used to evaluate journal and  as a consequence  authors and even institutions  In the case of theses   dissertations  in Brazil  the  quality  of the journal in which the resulting papers are published is important not only for the work  but for the graduate program  As a matter of fact  CAPES   Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal do Ensino Superior  http   www capes gov br    the federal agency in charge of the assessment of all graduate programs in the country  has a list called Qualis with international and national journals and the grading points they assign to graduate program evaluation  The Qualis list will be addressed later because it was used in this part of the project  A lot of energy has been devoted to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the impact factor and how it is to be viewed for different types of works in journals  An example is the work of Amim   Mabe  2000   where differences in behavior of the index are presented when different areas of knowledge  types and sizes of journals are present  the time frame of the measurement is also shown to be a cause of varying results  Some disciplines do not have journals in the extent of others  like biomedical areas and science   technology do  So  alternative impact factors can be searched in other types of works  Another example of 1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  discussion of the journal impact factor is presented by Dong  Loh   Mondry  2005  who also analyzed the impact factor and how the way calculations are performed may bias results  and presented questions the impact factor can not answer and alternative measures to evaluate journal impact  Different types of articles and journals show different behaviors related to impact factors  Amim   Mable 2000   An interesting result is presented by Garfield  1994  concerning review articles that are more cited because they contain extensive bibliographies  This characteristic is common to ETDs which contain state of the art bibliographic reviews  During many training sessions  the participants   librarians  graduate program deans and graduate students   described theses   dissertations as a source of bibliographies  But theses   dissertations are neither articles nor journals  The current concept of impact factor can not directly be applied to them  Theses   dissertations are presented in all areas in which graduate programs are available regardless the culture of journal publishing  This work addresses the preliminary results of a project that is in progress   2  CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT PUC Rio   Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro has had a digital library since 1995  when the Maxwell System  http   www maxwell lambda ele puc rio br   was created  In 1998  PUC Rio registered the system in INPI   Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial  http   www inpi gov br    the Brazilian patent office  The system started as a digital library of courseware and soon became a general purpose digital library  If a current term is used  it became an institutional repository  This was a consequence of the university using the system to store and deliver other types of documents  During the second semester of 1999  the ETD module of the system was developed and the first ETD was published in May 2000  The first ETDs came from three graduate programs that made them a requirement   Civil Engineering  Business Administration and Electrical Engineering  In 2001  other graduate programs joined the ETD project with local requirements  In August 2002  ETDs started being required for all graduate programs  Currently  there are over 2 400 ETDs on the system  The university s production of theses and dissertations is between 500 and 600 per year  Specific situations lead to the current number of ETDs  Civil Engineering had collected digital files of all theses and dissertations since 1997  Electrical Engineering started retrospective digitization of the whole collection  In other graduate programs  some digital files were obtained by person to person contact with alumni  The ETD project has been enhanced by adding new functions that are not related to allowing access to ETDs  They focus on data and information focusing graduate program administrators  Two sets of functions were implemented in the last 3 years   the first set contained statistics on the production of ETDs and the second on accesses to the works in the collection  Analysis of bibliographic references is the third enhancement to PUC Rio s ETD project   3  THE PROJECT ETDs are theses and dissertations in digital formats  Worldwide  most of them are texts  all ETDs on the Maxwell System are texts in pdf format  The fact that ETDs are in digital formats makes them suitable for the analysis of references since ICT   Information and Communication Technology tools can be used  2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  This project has the objectives of   1  Identify ETDs that are references in ETDs and try to establish a measure analogous to the impact factor   2  Map endogeny in graduate programs   3  Analyze the evolution of reference types from traditional  paper  to online works  The objectives required that references be extracted from the texts  classified  identified  stored on the database and analyzed  The project  therefore  started with the development of a set of computational tools to perform these operations  This paper presents the tools and some results from a sample set of ETDs  It is divided in sections to deal with the following topics           Extract references from ETDs   references are written in XML with a DTD for each type according to the ABNT   Associacao Brasileira de Normas Tecnicas  http   www abnt org br   standard used at PUC Rio  Each set of references is identified so that the ETD is known  Develop a set of tools to analyze quantitatively the references   numbers and averages by type  language  graduate program  year  etc  Currently  there are 9 types of analysis  Develop a set of tools to analyze qualitatively the references   relations of ETDs with works of authors  supervisors  other students of the same supervisor  other faculty  etc  Currently  there are 6 types of analysis  Choose a set of ETDs to be the sample and apply the tools to analyze them  Discuss the preliminary results in terms of reference contents  Discuss the problems with references in ETDs on the system  Present the next steps to automate extraction  identification  storage and classification of the references  Discuss with graduate programs faculty to gather suggestions for further developments and for a possible index  IF for T D     4  REFERENCES  FROM ETDs TO THE DATABASE The first activity was to get references from ETDs  All ETDs have a  references  section in a pdf file  References should be written according to the Brazilian reference bibliographic standard established by ABNT   Associacao Brasileira de Normas Tecnicas  http   www abnt org br    Unfortunately  there are many ETDs that are not compliant to the standard  this will be discussed in a later section  References are written as XML records with tags that identify the elements  There are different sets of tags according to the type of reference   books  chapters of books  articles in scientific journals  conference proceedings  websites  etc  Elements are dived in two sets     DCMES   Dublin Core Metadata Element Set elements   all elements that belong to DCMES  http   www dublincore org   are identified as  dc name of the element  and   dc name of the element   All other elements are identified as  maxwell name of the element  and   maxwell name of the element   This set has more elements since there are many types of references and each one requires a special set of attributes for its description  though some elements are common to almost all  title and language are two examples    All XML records are stored on table fields of the database and are managed by IBM DB2 Text Extender  http   www 306 ibm com software data db2 extenders text    Different types of search are used  Other types of data about ETDs and their references are stored on the database for regular relational database manipulation  the database management system is IBM DB2  http   www ibm com software data db2 udb     3   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Records needed to be created to prove concept  The first solution was manual cataloging using a program that generates XML records from a user friendly template  A similar solution will be used when students start using the templates to generate the XML records when they submit their ETDs files  At the same time  there are more than 2 400 ETDs on the system and their references must be captured as well as all others that are submitted before students are required to generate them  To solve the problem of current ETDs  a second solution is currently under final test  It is based on tools developed by Mr  Akeo Tanabe  M Sc  a researcher in the Computer Science Department of PUC Rio  He works with components in computational processes in the domain of natural languages for Brazilian Portuguese  This solution extracts records from reference sections of ETDs and  automatically  classifies and identifies them  Results are to be reviewed and corrected by a human being since the non compliance to the standard yields some errors  Mr  Tanabe is adjusting his solution and the number of errors has decreased in the last tests  The complete workflow of this process must be established given that ETDs grow at a rate of 500 to 600 per year   5  ANALYSIS OF THE REFERENCES As mentioned in section 3  two types of analysis are performed with reference records    Quantitative analysis  Qualitative analysis has the objective of yielding information on numbers related to references by type  language and year for each ETD and for graduate programs  Currently  there are 9 different types of combinations of these attributes to compute results  Some outputs present time series of the results while others show total numbers  all years   Figures 01 and 02 show the outputs for the number of references by type  language and graduate program   4   9th International Symposium on Electronic

by type  language and graduate program   type and language are presented and table cells are sensitive  5   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium

 after clicking the cell for articles in English in scientific journals the numbers by graduate program are shown    Qualitative analysis  Qualitative analysis has the objective of yielding information  not necessarily represented by numbers  that takes into account relations among works  authors  faculty  graduate programs and journals in the Qualis list  Currently  there are 8 types of searches and matches  One shows the numbers of each type of reference in an ETD  for any ETD  and shows the references when the ETD is public  Dealing with restricted works was a concern because the references  as parts of the work  are not shown when the author does not allow public access to a thesis or dissertation  Others identify references whose authors are related to the ETD  the supervisor  the ETD author  other faculty of the graduate program  other students of the same advisor  other faculty of the university  any author in the authority table  The last type is the one that finds ETDs whose references are articles in a chosen Qualis listed journal  Figures 03  04 and 05 show the outputs for references whose author is an advisor  after the advisor was selected  Figure 05 shows the situation of a public ETD  whose references can be displayed  When the ETD is restricted  figure 04 is the last possible information   only the numbers of references per type   6   9th

with numbers of references are sensitive if the ETD is public  Figure 05   Third part of the output for an advisor ETDs after choosing the ETD   the references whose author is the advisor are shown  Altogether  there are 17 options of viewing references  New programs may become necessary as the project continues   6  SAMPLE SET TO TEST THE ANALYSIS OF THE REFERENCES There are over 2 400 ETDs on the system from all graduate programs of PUC Rio  Some programs have ETDs that go back further in time than 2002  so their time series are longer  This may happen because the program started collecting digital files before others  for example Civil Engineering  or because the administrators decided to digitize paper theses and dissertations  for example Electrical Engineering  or because they contacted some alumni to get the digital files  for example Business Administration   In order to start the project  a sample set was chosen according to the following criteria       ETDs should come from the 3 centers of the university  Both the master and the doctoral levels should be included  Graduate programs with the longest time series on the system should have the preference  Public ETDs should preferably be chosen over restricted ones   Currently  there are 5 608 references from 75 ETDs coming from both master and doctoral levels from 8 graduate programs  The ETD distribution by center and program is     Human Sciences and Theology   Design  5 M   Education  4 M and 4 D  and Languages  4 M and 4 D   Social Sciences   Business Administration  9 M and 5 D  and History  4 M and 4 D   8   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada    Science   Technology   Computer Science  3 M and 4 D   Civil Engineering  7 M and 6 D  and Electrical Engineering  6 M and 6 D    It is planned that all ETDs on the data base be examined and also this process be applied when new ETDs are cataloged and uploaded on the system  The numbers will grow fast since the process of extracting references is under automation   7  RESULTS FROM THE SAMPLE SET The sample set is small if compared to the collection   approximately 3 1   But even such small sample yielded interesting results  Some are in terms of languages  others in terms of types    Languages  Languages are examined in 3 groups  in spite the existence of the numbers by language  The groups are English  en   Portuguese  pt  and other languages  ot   Other languages in this work are French  German  Italian  Spanish and others that were not accounted individually in the system  Table 01 shows the numbers of references in each group  by graduate program  and the corresponding averages  There are 3 076 references of all types in English in the sample set  The averages by graduate program are presented in table 01  Business Admin Civil Engineering Computer Science Design

sample   mean and median  Barros 2001   The averages per language were chosen because the numbers of ETDs per graduate program were different  ranging from 5 to 14  English Portuguese Other languages  Mean 35 2 23 2 3 2  Median 37 4 33 1 15 50  Table 02   Statistical information about the sample   mean and median for English  Portuguese and other languages in the sample set of 75 ETDs  When English is considered  graduate programs in Business Administration and Science   Technology have averages above the mean and the median  All other graduate programs are below both measures  When Portuguese is considered  graduate programs in Science   technology are below in both measures  The average number of references per ETD per program is shown in table 01 too  It can easily be seen that Business Administration has the highest average of reference per ETD   it is 27  higher than History the second in the rank  When the number of ETDs is higher than 75  these trends may vary  Other graduate programs may bring new insights to the language situation  though Portuguese and English are expected to be the most used  9   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada    Types of references  Books  chapters of books  articles in scientific journals  works in conference proceedings and theses   dissertations are the most used references  Table 03 shows the numbers for the sample  The total number of references is 5 608  as mentioned earlier  Articles in journals Books Chapters of books Theses   Dissertations Works in Conf Proceedings Other types  Number 1 690 2 332 564 221 377 424  Percentage 30 1 41 6 10 1 3 9 6 7 7 6  Table 03   Numbers and percentages of references by type in the sample set of 75 ETDs  Table 03 shows that T   D are less than 10  of the references  A curious number related to them is that from the 221  169 are in Portuguese  48 in English and the others in other languages  When books are concerned  Portuguese comes first with 1 375  then English with 823 and other languages account for the remaining number  Articles in journals switch the language pattern  English comes first with 1 436  then Portuguese with 202 and then other languages  At the moment  automation of the process is expected before additional programs are developed  The results of the analysis with more ETDs can guide the next steps   8  PROBLEMS WITH THE REFERENCES IN ETDs ON THE DATABASE The choice of starting this part of the project with extraction of references manually proved to be good  It allowed humans to examine the way references are written  The main problems can be grouped in        Classification   in many cases the references were so imprecise that it was not possible to assign a type to them   no title of a journal or number of an issue  Google helped to solve many of the problems  other problems were solved by contacting faculty in the graduate program  Identification of authors   the authors  names were not written in the ABNT standard  for there were many versions of the same author  specially when the authors had many middle names  For authors who belong to PUC Rio  students and faculty  an authority table was created  currently it is fed every time an ETD enters the system  Time and space   many references did not have years and or places of publishing  This is an important information when time series are analyzed  Identification of the same reference   different students and even the same student  in different parts of the work  identified references in different ways  This was very common with scientific journals that were abbreviated in many different ways  This problem also impacts the matching with journals in the Qualis list   When the process is automated  and the many tests have proven this  there must be a final review by a human and also there will be items that the system will not be able to identify  The latter is approximately 10  as shown by the initial tests   9  COMMENTS AND NEXT STEPS 10   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Although the results are from a small sample set  some points are interesting  The ones related to language and type are the most remarkable  Others can be mentioned   the way the types are distributed by the graduate programs  the difference between the master and the doctoral levels and the numbers of references whose author is the supervisor when the topic is very specific  At the moment  the first next step is to automate the process of extraction of references for the current ETDs   besides completing the tests and approving the final version of the extraction software  the workflow must be modelled  A following step is submitting a proposal to the Dean of Graduate Studies to request that students use the template to generate XML records when they deposit their ETDs   there are between 500 and 600 new ETDs per year  The third step is to view the results of the current programs when more ETDs have their references ready to be analyzed  This step will probably show the need of different data manipulation  The fourth step is try to identify an index  analogous to the impact factor  but for T   D  During steps 2  3 and 4 there will be interviews with advisors and graduate program administrators   10  REFERENCES Amim  Mayour   Mabe
