MODS Meets Manakin  Innovations in the Texas Digital Library s Thesis and Dissertation Collection Brian E  Surratt Fondren Library  Rice University  Houston  Texas  USA besurratt rice edu  ABSTRACT The Metadata Working Group  MWG  of the Texas Digital Library  TDL  was charged with developing a common descriptive metadata standard for electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  by December 2005  Based on the needs of the TDL and the characteristics of the existing collections  the MDW adopted the Metadata Object Description Schema  MODS  and subsequently developed an application profile tailored to ETDs  This paper describes the decisions the MWG made in order to express the elements of the ETD Metadata Schema  ETD MS  in MODS  The paper also discusses the TDL s use of Manakin  a module for DSpace that allows the development of a custom user interface based on XML  and how Manakin interacts with MODS metadata   Keywords  Electronic theses and dissertations  ETD  Metadata

members are the University of Texas  Texas A M University  the University of Houston  Texas Tech University  and Rice University  The mission of the TDL is to  provide a digital infrastructure for the scholarly activities of Texas universities   It is unique in that it includes four large public university systems as well as one private research university  The first project of the TDL was to develop a common repository of the electronic theses and dissertations  ETDs  published by the member libraries  At the time the project was initiated  two of the member universities  the University of Texas and Texas A M  had ETD collections  The University of Texas provides access to the local ETD collection through MARC records in the library s catalog and Texas A M provides access through Dublin Core records in DSpace  The Metadata Working Group  MWG  of TDL was charged with developing a common metadata standard that would allow members to share metadata in the TDL repository   2  CHARACTERISTICS OF MARC AND DUBLIN CORE In the United States  universities have traditionally provided access to theses and dissertations through the library catalog  Since the advent of online public access catalogs  or OPACS   this has meant applying the Anglo American Cataloging Rules  AACR2  and encoding the bibliographic information in a Machine Readable Catalog  MARC  record  A recent report on the cataloging treatment of theses and dissertations in the United States  Hoover and Wolverton  2003  only acknowledges MARC cataloging and is essentially blind to other formats and standards  including Dublin Core and ETDMS  MARC cataloging has a rich history  Traditional OPACS have strengths  such as authority control for names  but it is becoming clear that AACR2 and MARC cataloging are not suited to meet the 1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  descriptive metadata needs of ETDs  Developed in the 1960s  MARC is based on print catalog cards  It is a legacy standard and its shortcomings are magnified in the web environment  As a syntax for encoding bibliographic information  its characteristics are idiosyncratic  eg  fixed fields  indicators  etc   especially compared to modern markup languages that were purpose built for the web  Because it is so closely associated with AACR2 and ISBD punctuation  it mixes metadata content with formatting  Our OPACs  which are our primary systems for managing MARC records  are not designed to store content  but rather to point to the content in some other location  Our digital library systems  on the other hand  are not designed to store MARC records with our digital content  When libraries do use MARC to describe ETDs  it is applied inconsistently  Hoover and Wolverton  2003  demonstrated that MARC cataloging is inconsistent for information such as the genre  discipline  thesis advisor  and subjects  The ETD community has expressed the need for much of this information  see for example the ETD MS  and Frodl and Korb  2005    but the major cataloging guidelines either do not address how to encode this information or provide vague and inconsistent advice  AACR2 does not address the issue of advisor names  Bibliographic Formats and Standards states that  added entries for advisors  the institution  made up thesis collections or series titles  should be placed in locally defined fields  which encourages local policies and discourages establishing common standards  ETD MS  the descriptive metadata standard developed by the NDLTD  is valuable for defining the information that we want to know about theses  but because it is expressed through Dublin Core  it inherits Dublin Core s flaws  Guenther  2003  points out many of these flaws  There are not a sufficient number of elements to describe digital resources and the existing elements are too broadly defined  Dublin Core lacks a sufficient structure  It does not specify a syntax  so its implementation in networked systems is inconsistent  It does not possess what Guenther calls a substructure  or a hierarchy of elements  so there are problems with describing component parts  relating elements to component parts  relating descriptive elements to each other  and providing attributes and qualifiers to individual elements  These problems emerge distinctly when Dublin Core is applied to ETDs  The ETD MS field  dc contributor role  serves as an excellent example  As written  this field is impractical to implement  According to Dublin Core  elements should be represented as strict namevalue pairs  dc contributor Smith  John dc contributor role author dc contributor Brown  Jane dc contributor advisor No order for elements is specified in Dublin Core  hence    dc contributor Smith  John dc contributor Brown  Jane dc contributor advisor dc contributor role author    is equally valid  If this is done  Dublin Core does not provide a way to relate the two fields together in the description  If  alternatively  the role is expressed as an attribute of the contributor field  the way it is done in the ETD MS example on the NDLTD site     contributor role  chair  Joseph W  Roggenbuck  contributor     then it is not valid Dublin Core and hence dose not follow any particular standard  Similar problems emerge when Dublin Core is used to represent various dates in the life of the ETD  as well as descriptions of component parts of ETDs  Anecdotal evidence has shown that the application of Dublin Core to ETDs has been inconsistent  Dublin Core is designed for cross domain  ie  general  use  but institutions that host ETD collections often have specialized needs  MODS is better suited to address those needs  2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006

  it is partly based on MARC and carries forward the best features of this traditional cataloging format in a syntax that is defined in XML  Furthermore  it avoids many of the problems associated with Dublin Core  We were able to express almost all of the elements of ETD MS in a satisfactory manner  For those elements that we could not express in MODS  MODS provides a  mods extension  element that allowed us to refer directly to the ETD MS schema  Our philosophy was to define and specify the use of mandatory elements and significant optional elements  We also allow the use of any valid MODS element  even if it is not included in our application profile  Title information is encoded in the  mods titleInfo  wrapper element  The  mods title element is mandatory and the  mods subtitle  element is optional  The name of the author is encoded in a  mods name  wrapper element with the type attribute set to  personal   The given name and family name are encoded in  mods namePart  subelements  The birth date is optional  If it is included  it is placed in a  mods namePart  subelement with the type attribute set to date  The name of the advisor is a mandatory element and is encoded in a  mods name  wrapper element  The role of each name is specified using the  mods role  wrapper element  The MARC relator terms  Author  and  Thesis advisor  are used to define roles  The names of committee members are optional  Two dates are encoded in the  mods originInfo  wrapper element  the creation date and publication date  The creation date is defined as  the date the student graduates or the date the degree is conferred  and is encoded the  mods dateCreated  subelement  The publication date is defined as  the date the ETD is released to the public  and is encoded in the  mods dateIssued  subelement  The type of resource is mandatory  The  mods typeOfResource  element is generally equivalent to the MARC leader 06  The values for this field come from a controlled list defined in MARC that includes  text    sound recording    moving image   and  software  multimedia  among others  Genre is mandatory and is encoded in the  mods genre  element  All ETDs  regardless of level  are encoded with the MARC genre term  theses   Information regarding the physical details of the ETD is mandatory and is encoded in the  mods physicalDescription  element  The MARC format term  electronic  is encoded in the  mods form  element  The MIME type is encoded in the  mods internetMediaType  element  MODS also has field to record whether the item described is born digital or reformatted into a digital format and this is recorded in a  mods digitalOrigin  element   Langauge  is a mandatory element in the record  and can also be used as an attribute of any other MODS element  Other mandatory elements include abstracts  subjects  and information about the MODS record itself  ETD MS also includes extension elements outside of Dublin Core  thesis degree level  thesis degree discipline  and thesis degree grantor  TDL made all of these elements mandatory  The degree granting institution is represented in a  mods name  element with the type attribute set to  corporate  and  Degree grantor  in the  mods roleTerm  element  Degre level and degree discipline are not defined in MODS  so in order to include these  we had to use the  mods extension  element and refer back to the ETD MS   4  OUTSTANDING ISSUES FOR MODS METADATA There are a number of outstanding issues that the MWG will continue to investigate  The application profile does not include two elements specified by ETD MS  publisher and rights  Traditionally  print  3   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  theses and dissertations have been unpublished manuscripts  so library catalog records do not include publisher information in MARC records  For this reason  one of our member libraries did not want to include this element  In fact  cataloging rules are inconsistent on this topic  Section 3 1 of Bibliographic Formats and Standards states that theses and dissertations are usually considered unpublished manuscripts  but AACR2 rule 9 4B2 says that remote access electronic resources should be considered published  Libraries seem to have a hard time thinking of themselves as publishers  Furthermore  the issue of rights metadata was deemed sufficiently complex to be considered separate from the other descriptive metadata  The consequences of using the  mods extension  element to refer to the degree level and discipline are unclear  Related to this issue  the ETD community would benefit from a controlled vocabulary of disciplines  Further work could be done on standardizing the information in the  mods recordInfo  wrapper element  especially for identifying the source of the content and establishing a standard identifier for MODS records  For MARC records  much of this is work is coordinated by OCLC  but the ETD environment is decentralized and standardization may be more difficult  Theoretically  MODS has the capability for describing compound objects through the  mods relatedItem  element  but it is unclear how this should be done in practice  The problems include standardizing descriptive elements  developing systems that create metadata in an efficient manner  and managing this complex information in systems for search  retrieval  and display  TDL is creating MODS records though crosswalks from MARC and Dublin Core records  but these crosswalks have limitations  MARC records typically do not have all of the information specified in our application profile and Dublin Core records often lack sufficient descriptive specificity  Ideally  ETD management systems will be developed that create MODS records natively during the ETD submission process  If other types of records are desired  namely MARC or DC records  they could be derived from the MODS using standardized crosswalks   5  MANAKIN AND MODS Manakin  developed by Texas A M University  is a software package that allows institutions to customize the DSpace user interface  Phillips  et al   2005   The Manakin project has five goals  1  Allow each community to maintain a distinct look and feel  2  Separate business logic from stylistic design  3  Establish an interface level component architecture  4  Enable internationalisation and localization of content  and 5  Provide an alternative interface that does not replace the existing JSP interface  TDL  the first implementer  is using Manakin to extend a customized representation of the ETD collection into the general TDL website  Given highly specific metadata encoded in MODS and the ability to customize the user interface  TDL has a great deal of flexibility in designing a portal to its ETD collection  The TDL ETD collection conforms to the general design of the overall TDL site and has features such as a pre formatted citation for each ETD   6  CONCLUSION TDL adopted MODS as a common metadata standard for ETDs because of its benefits over MARC and Dublin Core  TDL implemented MODS in a union catalog that includes ETDs from two institutions  the University of Texas and Texas A M University  Manakin complements this rich ETD metadata by allowing the development of customized user interfaces for DSpace collections   4   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Although MODS represents a step forward  challenges remain  including publisher metadata  rights metadata  the use of non MODS extensions  standardization of record information  the description of compound objects  and the development of ETD systems that use MODS natively  TDL will continue to investigate these issues as well as promoting the development of ETD systems in Texas universities   7  TABLE COMPARING ETD MS AND TDL MODS ELEMENTS Table 1  Comparison of ETD MS and MODS Descriptive element Title information  M O M
