international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Abstract Students  faculty  researchers  and administrators desire  and in some cases require  that ETDs be preserved and made accessible for long periods of time  often 50 years or more  with the goal of support for the very long term  Part of the challenge of digital data preservation is for the  bits to be preserved   in spite of problems with infrastructure or disaster  Toward that end  the LOCKSS software  Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe  http   lockss stanford edu   supports replication  distribution  and reliable preservation of content  Since 2002  discussions have been underway regarding the use of LOCKSS in connection with NDLTD  The following six universities              Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro  Brazil Humboldt Universitat  Germany University of Cape Town  South Africa Florida State University  USA Georgia Tech  USA Virginia Tech  USA  are collaborating to demonstrate the functionality of the LOCKSS and OAI PMH for international preservation of ETDs  This report describes in detail the implementation for preservation and harvesting of International ETDs using LOCKSS tool  An analysis of the test results is also presented   iii   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe

goal of digital preservation is to ensure that the digital information remains readable and useable in the future  For any digitization project  one should ensure that only globally recognized standards  1  are implemented in the digitization methodology  Hence  a establishing and implementing a digital preservation strategy  which is reliable for decades to come  must be considered one of the vital aspects of a digitization project  As we know  the earlier the issues of digital data preservation are tackled  the easier it is to make the preservation strategy that matches the project specifications  1   Data retrieval should continue to be supported across platforms into the future   1 2 Motivation  The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD  is an international organization which aims to promote the creation  use  and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations in lieu of the traditional paper based theses and dissertations  Traditional paper based theses and dissertations are difficult to manage  use and preserve  Hence  many institutions in the world are advocating ETD submissions to individual students  We need a standard documentation especially for the preservation of ETDs  1 2 1 Existing Preservation Techniques Preservation of digital data involves the retention of the information object and its meaning  Hence  it is necessary for preservation techniques to be able to understand and re create the original form  2  of the information to make sure that it is authentic and accessible  The art of preservation of digital information is complex due to the fact that the information has a dependency factor on its technical environment  3   A consequential issue in digital persistence is that the one should ensure the integrity of information over decades and through the software development life cycle  6   How are digital data stored  Digital resources can be stored on any medium such as a CD ROM or a DVD  these media can represent the data s binary digits or bits   Hence  digital preservation involves copying the information into a newer media before the old media becomes stale or unusable  This is called copying or refreshing  4   But  simply  1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  copying the digital data into such medias is not enough for preserving them  One should be able to retrieve this information in the future and process it further  if needed  Different countries have different preservation strategies  Most of the existing preservation strategies involve replication of contents that are to be preserved  which are usually done in a central server   This is explained in the table below  Table 1   Preservation Strategies used in different countries Country India  Brazil  South Africa  Germany  Preservation Strategy Technique used 1  The digital collection is stored in floppy drives  CDs and Hard disk drives  2  The goal is to achieve a collaborative digital library  7   1  Lacks standards related preservation activities 2  Scientific data is being stored in information centers  databases that are proprietary in nature  8   3  Current practices are done by using traditional preservation technique  paper based  1  Digital Imaging Project of South Africa DISA  10  implement digital technologies to so that scholars and researchers from around the world can access South African material of high socio political interest 2  No concrete preservation training till now 1  Preservation strategies are being planned but  not implemented till now 2  The technical infrastructure is under implementation  1 2 2 Digital Data Preservation OAIS is a reference model for an Open Archival Information System  It describes all the functions of a digital repository such as how digital objects can be prepared  submitted to an archive  stored for long periods  maintained  and retrieved as needed  11   But  it does not address specific technologies  archiving techniques  or types of content  A checksum is a form of redundancy check which is a simple measure of protecting data integrity  Preserving the integrity of data is very important in any preservation technique  We should make sure that the digital data bits are not corrupted  Checksum techniques add up the basic components of a message and store the resulting value  The same operation is performed on the data bits  the results are compared to the authentic  2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  checksum  and if the sums match  it means that the message was not corrupted  MD5  Message Digest algorithm 5  is a commonly used cryptographic hash function used for checking the integrity of files  digital data   MD5 hashes are used to provide some assurance to the users that the downloaded file has not been altered  1 2 3 What is LOCKSS  LOCKSS  Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe  is a peer to peer digital preservation system  It is an open source software  5  which provides an inexpensive way to collect  store and preserve the local copy of authorized content  LOCKSS does not require so much of a technical administration or hardware requirements  Thus  LOCKSS converts a PC into a digital preservation machine  not just a place for backup   There are four main functions  5  to be performed by a library that uses the LOCKSS software  They are given below           It should collect the published content from the e journals by using a webcrawler  similar to internet search engines  It should constantly compare the collected content with the contents collected by other machines  detect and repair differences  damaged or missing pages  if found It should act as a web proxy and provide access to the preserved contents It should provide a web based administrative interface that lets the librarians to include new journals for preservation  monitor the existing journals  and provide controlled access to the journals which are being preserved   In the figure below  M1  M2  M3  M4  and M5 represent different universities  or institutions  who wish to preserve digital data  They are all connected to each other  In this preservation technique  the contents of one university are being preserved in all the 5 locations  For instance  M1 s collections are being harvested and preserved in M1  M2  M3  M4  and M5  By doing this  we create multiple copies of the same digital data in different locations  Hence  this becomes a distributed preservation technique  The main advantage of a distributed preservation technique is that   the data is not stored in a centralized server  Hence  loss of the collection in one or 2 of the servers will not affect the preservation  since there are copies in other servers  This is illustrated in the figure below   3   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  M2  Points to be noted   M1  M3 M5  M4  1  Nodes M1 through M5 represents participating universities  2  Preservation   we have multiple copies here  NOT just a backup   Figure 1 01  LOCKSS tool is built using Java  and it helps write plug ins for harvesting and preserving the digital data collection  The plug in is generated in XML format  The following table explains the meaning of some of the commonly used terms in digital data preservation using LOCKSS  Table 2   Technical terms in using the LOCKSS tool Some important terms  Meaning of the term with respect to LOCKSS and preservation  AU   Archival Unit  It is a unit of digital data which is to be preserved  This could be old or new e journals  ETDs  etc   Plug in Name  It is a user understandable name given to the plug in  for easy identification    Publisher Manifest page  or  Manifest page   1  For LOCKSS to identify that the digital data  ejournal ETDs  is to be preserved  it needs a permission page which gives rights to LOCKSS to preserve the collection  2  This is just a static HTML page with the permission statement written on it  with the link to the BASE URL  BASE URL  1  The URL which is some kind of a home page for the digital collection  ETDs or e journals  2  For example  the e journal collection  Virginia Libraries  has http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib  as its BASE URL   Crawl rules  These are rules are written using Regular Expression  which helps the LOCKSS tool to identify the files to be crawled and harvested  This is similar to the search engines   4   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  2  A Tutorial for creating Plug ins using LOCKSS tool   For  Developers  http   scholar lib vt edu lockss introduction htm   2 1 Introduction to LOCKSS Plug in Generation Tool The LOCKSS plug in generation tool provides a user interface that allows the user to create and test a plug in for simple and complex journals  The user input includes the details such as name of the plug in  name of the plug in ID  which is taken as the Java class name   name of the collection journal  the URL from which it should be fetched  extra parameters  if any   pause time between fetches  etc  The tool outputs a definition of the plug in for the chosen journal in XML  The next section starts with the tutorial explaining how to create plug ins with an assumption that LOCKSS is being installed in your machine   2 2 The Main window of LOCKSS Plug in Definer  The following screen shot shows how the LOCKSS tool would look like when you execute the batch file  runtool bat  from the corresponding location in the command prompt  There are totally 9 fields in the LOCKSS plug in definer tool  given below   The following sub sections discuss these parameters in depth  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9   Plug in Name Plug in ID Plug in Version Configuration Parameters Start URL Template AU Name Template Crawl Rules Pause Time Between Fetches New Content Crawl Interval  5   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 01  2 2 1 Plug in Name The name that the plug in will appear under in the configuration menu of the LOCKSS user interface  Spaces are allowed  Example  VirginiaLibraries 2 2 2 Plug in ID The Java class name for the plug in  The package structure should be maintained consistently  Example  edu vt lib plugin VirginiaLibraries 2 2 3 Plug in Version  A version number that differentiates different versions of the same plug in  It should start at 1  Example  1 2 2 4 Configuration Parameters  This defines the set of parameters that the plug in will use to identify and differentiate between each AU that uses the plug in  1  Example  The following screenshot represents the Configuration Parameters window  Consider the e journal  Virginia Libraries  The Base URL being http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib   6   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  2  In this website  we find that the journal issues are classified or grouped in terms of  Volume Numbers   Since we need to crawl the contents related to Volume numbers and issues  we can add the  Volume  Volume No    parameter from the available parameters section  in addition to the Base URL which is already added  to the Plug in Parameters section   see Figure 3 02   Figure 2 02  Figure 2 03  2 2 5 AU Name Template  7   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  This field is used to create the name of each Archival Unit  AU  using the plug in used by the LOCKSS administrative UI  1  In the LOCKSS plug in definer window  click on the NONE beside AU Name template  A new window as shown below would pop up   Figure 2 04  2  Select  String Literal  from the combo box and type in the corresponding name  here  Virginia Libraries  in the dialog box  Now  click OK in the dialog box and click on the  Save  button  3  Alternate condition  If you have a unique BASE URL and want to display that as the name instead of any string literal  select  BASE URL  from the combo box and click on the  Save  button  Similarly  if you want to display the BASE URL followed by the parameter  Volume Number  or  Year   select the corresponding parameter from the combo box and click on the  Save  button   8   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 05  2 2 6 Start URL Template   This template tells the plug in where to find the publisher manifest page for each AU of the journal  1  In the LOCKSS plug in definer window  click on the NONE beside Starting URL Name template  A new window as shown below would pop up   9   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 06  2  Select BASE URL from the combo box and click on  Insert Parameter  button  3  After the BASE URL gets inserted  select  String Literal  from the combo box  and click on  Insert Parameter   A new dialog box would pop up and the exact location in which the publisher manifest page lies should be entered there  Save the changes  a  Example  In this case  the publisher manifest page is  manifest html  and it its location is http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib lockss manifest html  10   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 07  2 2 7 Crawl Rules  The crawl rules define the boundaries of an AU in the journal s web site  An AU is normally a year s run or a volume of the journal  1  In the LOCKSS plug in definer window  click on the       beside  Crawl Rules  cell  A new window as shown below would pop up   Figure 2 08  11   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  2  In this Crawl Rule editor  you must start entering your rules for crawling  You might need to understand a few things about Regular Expressions  Add a new rule by clicking on the  Add  button  Now  click on the pattern  NONE  beside the action  Include    Figure 2 09  3  A new window as shown below would pop up  allowing you to enter or define the crawl rule  Select BASE URL from the combo box and do an Insert Parameter  Then  as before type in the String Literal  exact location in which the publisher s manifest page is located  in the dialog box and save the changes   Figure 2 10  12   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  a  Now  let us see how to include rules for a complex structure containing volume numbers  In the URL for VirginiaLibraries  http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib    consider the PDF file which is available in the location given by http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib v50 n2 v50n2 pdf  b  In the above PDF location  the BASE URL is followed by a series of characters  which can be represented using regular expressions  First select the BASE URL from the combo box and insert the parameter   Figure 2 11  c  The second step is to enter a String Literal  v   followed by the insertion of the Volume Number parameter   When you insert the Volume number  a new window would pop up  asking you to specify the padding value  Give OK for the default padding value of  0    d  The third step is to continue the rule   Having an underscore       followed by  n  as the string literal  After inserting the String Literal  select  Any Number  from the combo box and give an insert match  Now   0 9   will appear on the window  which is the regular expression format for Any Number  This means that the   n  can be followed by any integer number from 0 to 9   13   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 12  e  Finally  the string literals   v  followed by insertion of Volume Number  the string literal  n   and  any number  match has to be specified again  because the complete URL is http   scholar lib vt edu ejournals VALib v50 n2 v50n2 pdf  Now  enter the String literal   pdf  to specify the file type that has to be crawled  You will notice that a backslash is introduced before the dot  This is the representation of a dot in Regular Expressions format   14   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 13  f  Now  continue creating other rules to complete the Crawl rules section of the plug in  The final Crawl rule template editor would look like the figure shown below   Figure 2 14  15   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  g  In the last rule shown above  we have added a   to the end of that pattern  which will match the end of a string   If this is   is not given  the locations of all the files would be fetched irrespective of the volume number given during the test run   2 2 8 Pause Time between Fetches  The time for which the LOCKSS daemon waits after fetching each page from the publisher s web site  Example  6S  This is usually set at 6 seconds  2 2 9 New Content Crawl Interval  The time between attempts by the LOCKSS daemon to find new content on the publisher s web site  Example  2W  This is usually set as 2 weeks   2 3 Results  To view the crawl results  click on the  Plug in  pull down menu and click on  Test Crawl Rules  menu button  as shown in the screen shot   Figure 2 15  16   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  1  Now  a new window   Configure Crawl Rule Test  would pop up  Enter the details such the volume number for which you would like to view the test results and the BASE URL  Click on Check AU button   Figure 2 16  2  The results pane would be displayed in a new window  showing the test results  Scroll down to see detailed crawl results depending on the  Test Depth  entered   Note  While giving the Test Depth  Smaller integers are allowed  but  if you give large numbers like 15 or 20  a  FileNotFound  Exception will be thrown at the backend    17   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 17  2 4 Writing OAI Plug ins  The current version of LOCKSS does not have a support for writing OAI plug ins  So  we need to edit the XML file after we create the basic plug in  We also need the OAI  18   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Request URL for the plug in  For that  we need to do some changes in section 2 2 4  The following steps explain the procedure for including OAI Request URL     In figure 3 1  click on  Custom  button  A new  Custom Property Add  screen would be popped up  The values across each of the blanks are filled out as shown in the figure below   Figure 2 18    On clicking the  OK  button  the updated Configuration Parameter list will look like as shown below   19   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2 19         Subsequently  the other steps as explained in section 3 are followed and the plugin is completed  Once the plug in is completed  the XML file should be opened in any editor  and the Element value should be added as given by the XML statement   ElementValue xsi type  java java lang String  xmlns xsi  http   www w3 org 2001 XMLSchemainstance  OAI  ElementValue   This tells the plug in to use an OAI crawl instead of a regular crawl  Since this is an OAI plug in  we need to tell that where to find the OAI plug in  So  the Element value should be given just after the previous step   ElementValue xsi type  java java util ArrayList  xmlns xsi  http   www w3 org 2001 XMLSchema instance    string xsi type  java java lang String    slockss permission html   base url  string   3  Implementation For LOCKSS to harvest the ETD collections at any university  it needs a permissions page from the university  which grants the LOCKSS permission to use their ETDs for preservation and harvesting   3 1 Humboldt Universitat  Berlin  Germany The permissions page  popularly called as manifest page  for the ETD collections of Humboldt Universitat  Berlin  Germany is available at the location http   edoc huberlin de lockss    The plug in for this ETD collection is written using the LOCKSS tool  The screen shots of crawl rules and the test crawl results are given below  Since this is an OAI plug in  it needs a manual change in the XML file which is generated  In this case  the BASE URL is http   edoc hu berlin de lockss   20   9th

shows the statistics related to the harvest results of International ETDs  These were provided by Stanford University  as a proof that International ETDs are indeed being harvested properly   Figure 4

Figure 4 02  5  Future Work  5 1 Providing Public and Private Access Once the ETD collection is being harvested  the next step is to present it to the users  This should be done in a way which would be easily read and interpreted by the users   both the librarians and the people from the universities who wish to see the harvest status of their ETD collections  This could be done in the following way  5  1  1 For the Users  Open Archive or Open access  We can design a 3 tier Client Server architecture for the online portal system  which should be individually deployed in the participating universities  wherein the users can login and check the preservation status of their ETD collection  This statistical result need not contain intricate details like the  last crawl depth    content size   etc  It should only contain the details required by the public users  Since they are most interested in viewing the status  harvest successful or unsuccessful  of their ETD collection  only such details  26   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  need to be provided  The three tier client server architecture that could be designed for this purpose is shown in the following figure   Tier 1  User Interface  web GUI   Tier 2  Application Server  Tier 3  Primary Database Server  Business logic Layer Backup Database  if required  Figure 5 01  5 1 2 For the developers  Dark Archive or Restricted Private Access  Each university stores the contents of every other university it its local cache   To enable the developers and participating universities to view the statistical results  a detailed report of failures in harvesting could also be presented in a secure  restricted access  online portal  This would make the maintenance of the harvest results easier  and would help the universities involved to track the errors and correct them as and when needed  This is called a  Dark Archive   restricted access given to the developers and participating universities   A similar application  private access  is already being designed  and is in use for the Virginia Tech collection  as shown in the figure below   27   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires
