Brisbane Australia  PhD and Masters by Research candidates are required to deposit both print and digital copies of their theses and dissertations  The fulltext of these digital theses is then made freely available online via the Australian Digital Thesis  ADT  collection  Management of copyright issues has been a major headache and workload problem for the Library  there are many parties involved in the deposit process  and the lack of a common understanding about the rights and responsibilities of the various stakeholders has made the process very complex and time consuming  The response of some universities has been to limit access to just the metadata and abstract  At QUT this is not an option as the University is committed to freeing up access to publicly funded research and its outputs  QUT is also at the forefront of various open access initiatives  including the Open Access to Knowledge Law  OAK Law  Project that is working to develop legal protocols for managing copyright issues in an open access environment and investigate provision and implementation of a rights expression language for implementing such protocols  This paper discusses the aims of this project in relation to the QUT ETD experience  as well as how these fit in with the larger ETD open access environment  Keywords Digital theses  Copyright  Legal protocols  OAK Law Project  Online

in academic institutions  There are also policy reasons for the work of government aided research to be made available for the greater good  Various initiatives currently under way facilitate the wide dissemination of digital versions of theses and dissertations  ETDs   There are many technical and cultural challenges involved in the management and curation of digital theses  However  dealing with the copyright issues that arise when theses are made openly accessible poses a great challenge  Although theses and dissertations can be described as previously inhabiting the  unpublished world   1 some were copied and distributed by microfilm or photocopies between university libraries  However  the technologies developed over the last two decades have enabled unprecedented dissemination facilities for theses and dissertations  whether to a purely academic community  or the public at large  As with other types of works  copyright laws have not evolved in ways that facilitate the transition  Although the relevant laws may vary in their detail between jurisdictions  this is a global problem that needs to be addressed by every institution that accepts submission of theses in digital format  or is digitising from traditional paper based submissions  This paper will discuss the OAK Law Project  Open Access to Knowledge  that is working to develop legal protocols for managing copyright issues in open access environments  One set of protocols currently   being developed by the team will specifically address the problem of managing copyrights in digital theses  The paper will describe a case study involving the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane  Australia to provide contextual information about the nature and extent of the problem and to illustrate an environment in which the protocols can be communicated and implemented   2  AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE  In Australia  the Australasian Digital Thesis Program  ADT 2 was initially developed by a group of seven Australian universities  and is based on the work of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations  NDLTD  and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute  The ADT is a  distributed  collection in that the digital theses are processed locally and stored on a server at the home institution  The metadata is later harvested from participating universities for inclusion in the OAI compliant ADT database  The ADT website  http   adt caul edu au   provides a range of useful browse and search functions and  most importantly  it exposes the metadata to other search services  including Google   ADT summary records point back to the home institution for access to the full records and  when available  the files containing the full text of the thesis  in PDF format   At Queensland University of Technology  QUT   in Brisbane Australia  Masters by Research and PhD candidates are required to submit both a print and a digital copy of the final version of their thesis  This became mandatory at QUT at the beginning of 2003  Both copies are submitted to the Research Student Centre and later forwarded to the Library once the Office of Research is satisfied that all requirements have been met  QUT is faced with many copyright management issues in common with other Australian universities   2 1 Paper theses to digital theses Although all ETDs have copyright issues in common  where any paper thesis is converted to a digital thesis  p2ETD  extra issues may arise  For example  scanning the thesis without permission of the copyright owner  may breach copyright  and checking the thesis for third party materials is much harder to manage 3 Another issue is orphan works  the costs of finding the authors may exceed risk factor 4 Under the Copyright Act 19685  Cth  there is no inherent right to digitise paper based theses without the permission of the copyright owner or the existence of a licence  Such digitisation of paper based theses to electronic versions will most likely infringe the copyright owner s exclusive rights in the work  for example through reproduction or communication of the work  The main problem with retroactively distributing electronic versions of p2ETDs is the difficulty in getting the permission of the author  This permission seeking would be prohibitively expensive  One mooted option is to take a risk of copyright infringement actions  which are indeed unlikely  and engage in the digitisation and digital archiving process anyhow   2 2 Born digital The most pressing issue for the ETD is dealing with copyright in the submitted thesis that may be held by third parties  It is common that materials from other sources will be included to varying degrees in a thesis  This is very discipline dependant  the law PhD will typically have parts of legislation  cases and other commentary quoted  but usually small parts falling into the  not a substantial part of the original  category  and thus not a copyright issue   a fine arts thesis may replicate a number of complete original art works  thus requiring different treatment to deal with copyright   In addition to the simple copyright right under the Australian legislation  there have been recent changes in the law that raise more difficult issues   2 2 1 The communication right6 and ETDs Amendments to the copyright legislation by the Copyright Amendment  Digital Agenda  Act 2000 have created a new right  the communication right  that can impact ETD repositories  These amendments were   directed at implementing Article 8 World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty  WCT 7  that states  Article 8 Right of Communication to the Public Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 11 1  ii   11bis 1  i  and  ii   11ter 1  ii   14 1  ii  and 14bis 1  of the Berne Convention  authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing any communication to the public of their works  by wire or wireless means  including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them   Agreed statements concerning Article 8   It is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Treaty or the Berne Convention  It is further understood that nothing in Article 8 precludes a Contracting Party from applying Article 11bis 2     This provision of the WCT has been interpreted in various ways in different jurisdictions  The Australian legislation now gives an exclusive right  to communicate the work to the public 8 to the copyright owner  Communicate is defined in s 10   communicate  means make available online or electronically transmit  whether over a path  or a combination of paths  provided by a material substance or otherwise  a work or other subject matter  including a performance or live performance within the meaning of this Act   s 22 6  provides that For the purposes of this Act  a communication other than a broadcast is taken to have been made by the person responsible for determining the content of the communication   This envisages two types of communication  the  making available  of a work  and the  electronic transmission  of a work  This may have particular repercussions for repositories  raising some questions     Is putting the ETD in a repository   that is that can be accessed by the public  within or outside Australia   a communication of the work for the purposes of the Act      Is the repository the party making the work available by hosting on a server      Is it liable for either the making available or the electronic transmission  ie any breaches in either student or third party exclusive rights to communicate      Can the repository claim that it is not the  person responsible for determining the content of the communication   Section 39B of the Copyright Act 1968  Cth  provides that A person  including a carrier or carriage service provider  who provides facilities for making  or facilitating the making of  a communication is not taken to have authorised any infringement of copyright in a work merely because another person uses the facilities so provided to do something the right to do which is included in the copyright    Many repositories  such as those affiliated with ADT  could be seen in much the same light as an ISP had they kept to a simple  candidate deposits repository distributes  and taken a completely  hands off  approach  However  the reality is that most repositories are much more active in constraints on the material deposited  let alone mentioning the role of the institution that is  mentoring  the thesis  This means that authorisation of a breach is possible  New Right suggests that the  uploader  is responsible for determining the content of the communication  without defining  uploader   but context suggests the  server  side   But in the case of a repository  it would be the repository that is responsible for the content of the communication  The repository is responsible for the electronic transmission when the work is downloaded    This is clearly a serious problem for ETDs  and also for p2ETDs  paper to electronic theses and dissertations     Make sure that communication right is also licensed with reproduction rights when deposit made     Potential infringement when the work is made available  i e  even before downloaded      The need of a license for right to communicate from 3rd party may be required     The exemptions for fair dealing  and the insubstantiality defence should be considered  2 3 Third party content It should also be noted that issues regarding third party content may arise when considering the communication right and electronic and theses and dissertations  In particular where there has been an unauthorised use of third party content  it is possible that potential infringement to the communication right will occur at the time when the work is made available  This infringement will occur where one of the copyright owner s exclusive rights has been infringed  for example through reproduction  performance  publication  communication or adaptation of the work  It should also be noted that the act of communication will occur even before the electronic theses or dissertation is downloaded by the user  It is therefore essential that the third party gives the copyright holder of the electronic theses or dissertation permission or a licence to communicate their work  The following options are available in relation to third party materials     encourage the candidate to give to the repository the license to  publish   as with QUT  at outset  such as before signing up for the programme      encourage the candidate to self censor for 3rd party materials that are not authorised for digital distribution  However  this would require that candidates be given an introductory session on the process in their induction into the programme   i e  not only information that they must  cite  or it is plagiarism  but they must also  cite   permissions  as required  This is a hard problem  it is often difficult  even for an expert in the copyright field  to judge whether permission is required  a paragraph from an article  probably not  a  crucial  photo from a work  probably yes  but there are many grey areas  The input into the ETD  in some disciplines  may also include material that has copyright held by the university  for example  perhaps a technician takes a photograph of a gel in a molecular biology laboratory as part of employment as normal laboratory work   or of other student  for example  one contributes some code that forms part of the final work    3  ONE APPROACH  In an attempt to ensure that the higher degree students at QUT were sufficiently informed on this matter  the Research Student Centre  in collaboration with the university Library and the QUT Copyright Officer  incorporated information about copyright into their advice for students and supervisors on their  Thesis Examinations  web page 9 In the QUT nine page booklet on  Requirements for Presenting Theses   there is included the following information on copyright permissions   Copyright materials incorporated in theses can only be reproduced in the ADT database with proof of written permission from the copyright holder  author or publisher as relevant to the work   It is acknowledged that in the case of thesis by publication  it may not be possible to reproduce the published works in ADT  The student is responsible for seeking and obtaining signed and dated written proof of permission from copyright holders to digitally reproduce copyright material on the ADT database  Students should use the  Permission to reproduce copyright material  on the ADT  form that can be found at  http   www research qut edu au downloads ADT copyright owner request doc   Additionally  the booklet informs the student that the electronic copy deposited with the Research Students Centre should include written proof of copyright permission if required  Where no written proof of permission is provided  the Library will remove the copyright material leaving 10 reference to the copyright source before loading the thesis on the ADT database   As this booklet also contains detailed formatting requirements  it was assumed that all students would read the booklet during the early stages of writing up their thesis and would  therefore  have plenty of time to gather any necessary copyright permissions  Once the thesis has been examined  a  Request for Submission of the Final Thesis  form must be completed and signed by the candidate and then signed off by the candidate s supervisors and the Director of the Research Centre or the Faculty Research Committee Chair  Two statements about copyright materials are included in this form  see figure 1    8  The thesis contains copyright materials Yes  No  Comment                                                        9  The thesis does contain copyright materials and the mandatory relevant documentary evidence for approval from the copyright owner is attached using the ADT Copyright owner request form downloaded from either http   www library qut edu au adt deposit  or http   www research qut edu au downloads ADT copyright owner request doc Yes  No  Comment                                                         Figure 1  Copyright questions from the existing  Request for Submission of the Final Thesis  form  Unfortunately  it appears that many candidates have not taken onboard the advice about copyright in the  Requirements for Presenting Theses  booklet and  consequently  they may not understand this section of the form  It could also be that the wording of the form is ambiguous and needs revision  Currently  quite a few theses are found to contain copyright materials even though the signed forms attached to the theses indicate that they do not  In other cases  the form indicates that the thesis contains copyright materials but no permissions are attached and no comments or details are provided  In a small number of cases  the whole section is just left blank  When the proposal for a policy mandating submission of a digital version of each thesis for inclusion in the ADT was discussed by the QUT Research Degrees Committee  it was suggested that candidates should be given a second chance to furnish the required permissions before any material was removed from a digital thesis  It was also recognised that it was necessary to have the candidate authorise the removal of any material  Consequently  both of these issues are addressed in the  Request for Submission of the Final Thesis Form   see Figure 2     I  the candidate  am aware that the University will undertake to write to me at my last known address to advise of any additional copyright materials identified in my thesis  This will provide me with another opportunity to obtain provide documentary evidence of approval from the copyright owner to include materials  Where I do not provide such evidence I authorise copyright materials to be removed from the electronic thesis leaving reference to the original source on the copy of my thesis available via the ADT  Figure 2  Authorisation to remove copyright material from a thesis   The inclusion of an authorisation to remove copyright materials is absolutely necessary  However  the Library may need to reconsider the undertaking that they will check for copyright materials and write to candidates to give them a second chance to obtain the necessary permissions  This undertaking has created a number of serious problems for the Library  Firstly  the undertaking infers that the Library staff processing the digital theses for inclusion in the ADT will scrutinise every page of every deposited thesis to identify any third party copyright materials that have been overlooked by the candidates  Consequently  this is exactly what is currently done at QUT  Secondly  if a candidate knows that the Library will be checking their thesis for third party copyright material  they may form the impression that they do not need to address the questions on the submission form about copyright material in their thesis  Checking each page of every thesis is exceedingly time consuming and creates a backlog of theses waiting to be processed  It also creates a stressful situation for the para professional Library staff who are required to judge whether each figure or table was created by the candidate or a third party  The only people who should be making these judgements are the authors  or in the extreme  a court   Currently  if any copyright infringing material is found to have been included without permission of the copyright owner  a letter is sent to the candidate s last known address to inform them that they have sixty days to provide the necessary permissions or the material  as described in the letter  will be removed from the digital version of the thesis  By this stage  the candidate has often left the University and  in some cases  can no longer be contacted at the last known address  For various reasons  some letters remain unanswered yet the Library must wait sixty days before finishing the processing of the thesis for ADT  In other cases  the student advises the Library that they will send the  Permission to reproduce copyright material  letters immediately  even though they have already had at least three years to do so  Doublehandling of the digital thesis is unavoidable in either case  thus contributing to the backlog  Dealing with such problems is not trivial  The response of some universities is to provide online access to only the metadata and abstracts of their theses  However  QUT is committed to freeing up access to the full text of publicly funded research outputs so this option is not acceptable   3 1 Revised Approach A revised approach is currently being considered by QUT Library  Under the revised model  all research students at the University would be well informed about the relevant copyright issues  at various times throughout their studies and via various channels  Given sufficient information and support  it should be possible to rely upon the PhD and Masters by Research candidates to supply information that is both accurate and sufficiently detailed  It should also be reasonable for the Library to accept and act on the basis of the information supplied by the candidate  The current practice of page by page checking of every thesis could then be replaced by random or selective checking  We believe that this approach makes sense for two reasons  Firstly  only the candidate knows which part of their thesis  if any  is the work of another person  Secondly  this approach allows the candidate to control exactly what is removed from the version of their thesis that is most likely to be accessed and   read  However  reaching this stage will take time and a great deal of effort  To simply shift all the responsibility  immediately  to the candidates would be unfair  They really need to understand what they are being asked to sign  why it matters and how they can comply  There are many steps that need to be taken to make this a reality     During the orientation process for research students  there needs to be a session on intellectual property and copyright as it relates to research and theses so that all students understand their rights  and the rights of others      Any training program for research supervisors needs to include a similar session so that they can better advise their students on these issues  or at least refer them to relevant sources of expertise within the university      Information literacy training programs aimed at research students need to include  in their objectives  the development of relevant copyright knowledge and skills  Avoiding breaches of copyright needs to be incorporated alongside discussions on correct referencing and avoiding plagiarism      There needs to be a guidebook  online but printable  on requirements for presenting theses that includes detailed information about the copyright issues relating to the digital version of the thesis plus clear instructions on how to send permission requests  The guidebook also needs to provide information about the thesis submission stage explaining the role  the importance and the implications of the questions on copyright material in their thesis      Librarians who liaise with research students need to be well informed so that they are able to help or advise students how to track down copyright owners to seek the permissions they require      The procedures and forms for thesis submission need to be designed in such a way that all necessary information MUST be provided before the thesis can be signed off   However  before this can happen  we need some detailed yet understandable information to communicate to the stakeholders and guide the development of new procedures  That is  we need protocols for handling digital theses and dissertations   4  OAK L AW PROJECT  As part of the DEST funded project 11 particular attention has be paid to the development of protocols that will aid the handling of ETDs for their legal problems to be minimised  Although in early stages  the key aspects addressed follow   4 1 Licensing When considering which license types should be used in relation to electronic theses and dissertations it is necessary to be aware of the following four types of licences  Deposit licence A deposit licence is required in order give certainty to repositories  in terms of what rights they have to store  manage and organise the electronic theses and dissertations stored within the repository  Deposit licences are also a vital means for repositories in establishing a formal contract with the depositor  reassuring the depositor that that the repository is not claiming rights in their work and most importantly reducing the repository liability is a theses or dissertation is found to have infringed copyright  End user licence The end user  i e  the person that downloads a thesis  should know what they can do with the license  Just read it on the screen  Print and read  Make copies and distribute in class  To answer these questions we suggest the adoption of a standard  though flexible  protocol for end user licensing  For example  it would   be straightforward for the ETD copyright holder to license end users with one of the Creative Commons licenses  Creative Commons licences The copyright owner of the electronic theses or dissertation may choose to licence end users of the theses with one of the Creative Commons licences  Importantly  licensing work under a Creative Commons licence does not mean giving up the copyright in the electronic theses or dissertation  Instead  it means offering some of the copyright owner s rights to users  but only under certain conditions 12 Under this approach the copyright owner may select one or a combination of the following Creative Commons licence types     Attribution   The electronic theses or dissertation may be freely copied and redistributed  as long as credit is given to the creator of the work  You can also define certain conditions on other people s use of your work by mixing and matching from the optional terms below      Non commercial   Users may copy  distribute  display and perform your work   and derivative works based upon it   but for non commercial purposes only      No derivative works   The electronic theses and dissertation may be copied  distributed  displayed and performed  but only verbatim copies of it and not derivative works based upon it      Share alike   Users may distribute derivative works only under a licence identical to the licence that governs your work   4 1 1 Third party licence It is also necessary to consider third party licences where a third party has contributed work to the theses or dissertations  This licence is an important part of mitigating liability if the electronic thesis or dissertation is found to have infringed copyright of a third party  The licence between the publisher and the repository may be crucial where a PhD candidate has assigned the copyright of part of their theses  such as where they have had an article published prior to submitting the electronic theses and dissertation   4 2 Protocols for the Handling of Theses 4 2 1 Student    Students must receive training before embarking on their theses so that they are aware of legal issues and requirements      Ideally the student will gather permissions for use of a whole or substantial part of the copied parts of works      3rd party copyright material to be identified by the student   a tag to enable automated handling would be useful  so that      Permission records can be harvested     If any necessary permissions are not provided at the time of submission  the students should give permissions for this materials  which THEY have identified  to be removed  They have had at least 3 years to get the permissions      Mandatory inclusion of stable post university contact route     Adaptations acknowledged  as such in any figure captions     Mandatory inclusion of keywords   4 2 2 Repository    The repositories need clear guidelines as to the steps they need to take to minimise risk of action      The adoption of standard protocols and workflow can help to minimise such problems   4 2 3 End user    5  The end use of the ETD should be made aware of the license  as discussed above  eg a creative commons license  and the terms on which they are able to access theses   CONCLUSIONS  Some great work has been done by ADT and other ETD projects on the implementation of access control to theses  More work on the management of the workflow is required with particular attention to the copyright and licensing issues  Development to allow for flexible and automated structures that meet the policy needs and satisfy copyright and other legal constraints is crucial  Our work has made some progress down this path   6  REFERENCES  The Authors thank Damien O Brien for his research assistance on this project  1 2 3 4 5  Joyce  T   Out of the shadows   a new approach to copyright for digital theses and
