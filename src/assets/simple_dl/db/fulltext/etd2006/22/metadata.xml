Digital Libraries  Implementation Strategies  Open Access  Incentives Abstract Institutional repositories  IRs  in higher education serve a number of purposes including collecting  preserving  making accessible and promoting university research  Collaboration between the administration  the libraries and the information technology groups is critical to the success of IR programs in order to serve the diverse needs of the university population  Research is discovered much more rapidly and citation counts increase dramatically  particularly in an online open access environment  ETD programs have proven their worthiness in this manner for graduate students  however  faculties are just beginning to understand these implications in regard to their own research dissemination  Even publishers are reexamining their views on open access  This presentation will explore the evolution of the IR at West Virginia University as well as various political dimensions related to mandatory versus voluntary submission policies  Introduction Institutional repositories are digital library collections and related services through which internally generated research can deposited  preserved and accessed on the Web  West Virginia University launched its own institutional repository  the Electronic Institutional Document Repository  eIDR  program in fall 2005  The eIDR system includes portals to WVU graduate  undergraduate  faculty and administrative research collections  Overview The first collection evolved from the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation  eTD  program  which serves graduate  master s and doctoral  students and has been a part of the graduation requirement since 1998  WVU was 2nd in the world to have mandated a required ETD submission policy   The next collection  the Electronic Scholarly Resources Archive  eSRA  serves the faculty and ETD 2006 Presentation   WVU EIDR   John H  Hagen   West Virginia University Libraries  1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses

and includes publications such as pre prints  post prints  technical reports  white papers  conference proceedings  and institutional   administrative reports  The newest collection added was the Electronic Honor s Theses  eHT  program  which serves undergraduate honors students  The Honors College now requires electronic submission of a thesis about their final capstone research experience  Background The initial project began with the implementation of the ETD program  now in its 8th year  and has evolved into an improved digital library system with new collections to serve the entire university community  The eTD module averages over 1 million accesses  thesis and dissertation file downloads  per year  This represents a 145 000  increase in access over our print thesis and dissertation collection  Our most popular dissertation was accessed over 15 000 times in the first year of release  Faculty have found the system to be an invaluable tool  not only for submission  review and discovery of basic research  but also as an administrative tool to compile promotion and tenure reports as well as departmental reviews for accreditation  The eSRA program followed with a pilot to collect the proceedings from ETD Symposia 2000   2002  the collection was recently migrated to the new eIDR system  This module naturally segued into an all purpose repository for faculty submissions  but has been underutilized used by our faculty  Recent requests have been considered to host collections such as administrative planning documents and statistical reports  undergraduate service learning portfolios and graduate music bibliographies  The latest module we developed  eHT  is very similar to the eTD module but customized for their program needs  and was implemented in fall 2005  The eHT collection is entirely open access  Most of these students will go on to produce ETDs as graduate students  The Honors program was recently elevated to the status of a college in the University to remain consistent with national accreditation standards  The eHT collection will help support this important mission by providing access to the research of our young budding scholars  With the assistance of a number of faculty and staff members from the Office of Information Technology  the University Libraries  and the WVU ETD Task Force  the team has been working diligently since fall 2004 to complete the new submission and access portal systems on the Oracle platform  Oracle is the same system that WVU utilizes for its centralized human resources and financial functions  and is used by many commercial IR service providers   ETD 2006 Presentation   WVU EIDR   John H  Hagen   West Virginia University Libraries  2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The Future In the coming year we are planning to put out a request for proposals to seek commercial vendor support for the institutional repository programs at WVU  It is imperative that we have a single system capable of supporting the full range of DAMS  digital asset management system  functions  Resources such as the SPARC Institutional Repository Checklist   Resource Guide were utilized in preparation of this process  Given the considerable impact on the collection and distribution of university research  it is important that we integrate into the eIDR system a strong commitment to and compliance with the latest technology available  Commercial IR systems offer full support for integrated NISO and NIST industry standards such as Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  to share our resources with conglomerates such as Google Scholar via Dublin Core metadata output and to provide for automated cataloging processes via MARC 21 metadata output   METS  Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standards   Z39 50  universal catalog protocol   JPEG2000  image base standard   EAD  Encoded Archival Description   MODS  Metadata Object Description Schema   TEI  Text Encoding Initiative   full text indexing and search capability  XML  UNICODE  Single Sign on LDAP authentication and e preservation strategy  Keeping up with this constantly changing technological environment has presented great challenges to our in house operation  Additional factors warranting this next step include reduction of a growing over dependence on internal IT support  competing demands and deficiencies in IT development and technical resources necessary to maintain a project of this size  A review of various commercial and open source IR systems including 5 year projected cost estimates for migration and annual maintenance was completed in spring 2005  Open source systems were also considered  however  the high cost of customization  migration  implementation and maintenance would not outweigh the benefits and competitive cost of a stable and proven commercial system where expert support is continually provided  For example  Florida State University reported that the estimate for an IT developer to get D Space up and running would have been  180 000  although the software is freely available  set up is not free  Of all the systems we have reviewed  the Ex Libris DigiTool product appears to rate among the highest in terms of efficiency  standards integration  presentation and value  Campus demonstrations for vendors will be scheduled for fall 2006  with vendor selection  migration and implementation to follow  and final launch of the new system scheduled for fall 2007  Open Access and Incentives As has been demonstrated at peer doctoral research institutions  the collecting of  typically  unpublished academic materials offers tremendous exposure for the school  is critical to the assessment of the scholar s and institution s well being  ETD 2006 Presentation   WVU EIDR   John H  Hagen   West Virginia University Libraries

as an aid to institutional planning and results in enabling departments to better plan and fine tune program offerings  As we shall see  many experts in the field advocate mandatory open access for ETDs and faculty research  In his opening keynote address at the ETD 2006 Symposium  Peter Suber  Budapest Open Access Initiative  indicated that 70  of publishers currently allow open access to their post prints  noting that the US will soon mandate open access for major government funded research within 6 months of release  The studies reviewed by Stevan Harnad  ePrints   University of Southampton  as presented at the ETD 2005 Symposium demonstrated that scholars  who in addition to publishing in the traditional academic journal avenues also deposit their works into open access IRs  are cited between 2 and 5 times more often  He suggests that some scholars have experienced even as much as 50  to 250  increase in citations  In his closing keynote address at the ETD 2006 Symposium  JeanClaude Guedon  University of Montreal  pointed out that faculty often don t know what is good for them but attitudes will change as they see the popularity of their student s thesis and dissertation research when given open access  this will entice scholars to submit their research to IRs  He even goes on to advocate that institutions of higher learning should automate their promotion and tenure evaluation systems  and use deposits to IRs to document their progress  As a case in point  from 1998 to 2005 WVU has seen a 28  increase in the number of students willing to provide open access to their ETDs  having grown from 53  to 81  in just five years time  We have found that education and recognition through citation are the key factors in determining how a student and committee members will approach the notion of Web distribution of the ETD  Further  the ETD program has now received over 6 million accesses since inception  faculties are taking notice of their student s research dissemination and the resulting citation augmentation  Just as with the open access dilemma for ETDs  how long can an institution afford to wait before taking the electronic plunge at the faculty research level  By expanding our digital library initiative to include not only the graduate  but also the undergraduate and faculty population  the IR program provides an incredible benefit to our students  faculty  staff  research programs  the institution  and indeed the international scholarly community by delivering the unique global exposure that only open access on the Internet can provide  Additionally the centralized institutional repository program offers the perfect mechanism for the deposit  search  discovery and acquisition of research materials  WVU graduate research documents are now are accessed millions of times per year by academia  industry  government and the public from over 100 countries  and we expect similar usage among the new eHT and eSRA collections  The eIDR program is part of a growing trend of technological development that is transforming economies by providing access to research results to the world while bringing reciprocal investment back to the local level   ETD 2006 Presentation   WVU EIDR   John H  Hagen   West Virginia University Libraries  4   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe
