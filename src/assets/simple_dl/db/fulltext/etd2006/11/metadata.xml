DAITSS  ANOTHER PRESERVATION OPTION FOR ELECTRONIC THESES   DISSERTATIONS Priscilla Caplan Florida Center for Library Automation pcaplan ufl edu Chuck Thomas Florida Center for Library Automation cthomas ufl edu 1  ABSTRACT Electronic theses and dissertation  ETDs  are an important and valuable part of the growing body of digital materials that must be preserved by college and university libraries  This paper reviews some of the current options and applications available to help implement bona fide digital preservation environments for ETDs  DAITSS  a new product being developed by the Florida Center for Library Automation for this purpose  is explained and differentiated from other available tools   2  CURRENT OPTIONS As an increasing number of institutions are moving to digital theses and dissertations  the need to address the long term preservation of ETDs in digital form becomes more pressing  Preservation is more than establishing bibliographic control  ensuring secure storage  and encouraging the use of  preservationfriendly  formats  While these are necessary steps  preservation planning should also include the implementation of active preservation strategies  There are several current options for the long term preservation of ETDs  One option is to rely upon a paper or microfilm copy of the ETD as the permanent archival copy  This has the advantage that we know how to handle these media and have some confidence in their preservation qualities  However  the process of deriving a paper or microfilm preservation master risks losing functionality not supported by these media  such as internal or external linkages and embedded or associated media objects like video and audio files  A second approach is for the graduate school to require ETDs to be created in certain formats considered to be more  archivable  than others  Many schools now require theses to be submitted in PDF or HTML  some encourage PDF A  and some are considering or supporting XML encoding  Supplementary files in other formats may be accepted  but they are considered add ons rather than integral parts of the dissertation  It is wise to be concerned about the preservation properties of digital formats  and probably good policy to set guidelines for what can be submitted  However  this alone does not constitute a concrete preservation plan for managing the preferred format  A third approach is to contract with commercial third parties that offer preservation services   Bit level  preservation services guarantee digital files are unaltered and readable from media though methods such as secure storage  redundancy  and fixity checking   Full  preservation services include strategies to counter format obsolescence  such as forward migration  normalization  and or emulation  The OCLC Digital Archive was one of the first third party options available  Although only bit level preservation is supported at this time OCLC intends to move to full preservation treatment for harvestable  1   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7

needs  OCLC  2006   Their goal is to eventually meet the certification criteria of a Trusted Digital Repository  RLG  2005   Another player in the emerging third party market is ProQuest UMI  a long time service provider for libraries and universities  Since 2002  ProQuest has teamed with the Berkeley Electronic Press in a collaborative Digital Commons institutional repository initiative for online access to digital research papers such as ETDs  ProQuest also now markets a Digital Archiving and Access Program  Like OCLC  the ProQuest archive plans to move beyond bit level services to full preservation  and aims to become a certified as a trusted digital repository  McLean  c 2004   A fourth option for archiving ETDs is for an institution to manage its own preservation repository  DSpace  an open source institutional repository system from MIT  is a popular platform that accepts all kinds of digital content and can accommodate ETDs  DSpace now provides bit level preservation  but mechanisms for full preservation strategies are being developed by the open source community under the auspices of the DSpace Federation  Several other open source products compete with D Space  including ETD db from Virginia Tech and the popular E Prints software from the University of Southampton  However  many of these tools are primarily designed for access and use copy management  and would have to be combined with other applications and processes to constitute a true archiving environment Fedora  another open source product  provides great promise for organizations able to devote resources to building onto its underlying storage and dissemination architecture  Some institutions  such as theUniversity of California  are building their own state of the art digital repositories  or mixing a variety of applications together to provide the services and processes of a true preservation environment as described in the OAIS framework  Finally  commercial systems such as DigiTool from Ex Libris are finally coming into the library systems market with built in tools enabling better digital preservation management   3  THE DAITSS OPTION The Florida Center for Library Automation  FCLA  is pursuing this fourth option on behalf of its partners  FCLA is a state agency created to support the automation needs of the libraries of the public university system of Florida  FCLA runs the Florida Digital Archive  FDA  as a preservation repository for the collective use of the eleven state universities  The primary motivation for building the Florida Digital Archive was the desire of the library directors to assure themselves of the long term preservation and usability of the ETDs for which they were responsible  The libraries can batch submit ETDs and other materials to the repository for archiving  and they can request archived materials back in usable form at any time  The FDA began operating in November 2005  and as of June 1 2006 it has ingested 11 786 information packages  digital books  photographs and ETDs  comprising 118 918 files requiring 2 7 TB of storage  The software application underlying the FDA is named DAITSS  Dark Archive In The Sunshine State   DAITSS is a Java application that runs under Linux and uses MySQL for the management database  FCLA 2005   It is designed as an implementation of the major functional areas of the Open Archival Information System  OAIS  framework  Ingest  Data Management  Access  Archival Storage  Preservation Planning and Administration  It uses established and emerging library standards wherever possible  including the PREMIS core preservation metadata element set  Z39 87 technical metadata for digital still images  and METS   2   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  DAITSS is a system for digital preservation only  it has no other function  Unlike some repository systems initially designed for storage and access and now being revised to support preservation  DAITSS was designed from the beginning to implement the active preservation strategies of format normalization  mass migration  and migration on request  In order to perform full preservation for a format  Java classes to handle the file format and any relevant bitstream formats must be programmed and included in the DAITSS libraries  DAITSS is designed to be extensible to any number of formats  All preservation strategies are implemented in the Ingest function as materials enter the system  Every incoming file is preserved in perpetuity exactly as it is received  but certain other versions may be created depending on the file format  A normalized version will be created if the incoming format can be transformed into a more  preservable  version  For example  a CinePak video stream within an incoming Quicktime file will be normalized to Motion JPEG  A localized version will be created if the file contains external links that can be downloaded  stored locally  and referenced by a relative file path  For example  an XML file that references a schema and a stylesheet will be localized if possible to facilitate future validation  A migrated version will be created if the file format is considered in danger of obsolescence and a successor format exists  Content stored in the repository can never be changed  but it can be disseminated and re ingested if a format migration is necessary in the future  DAITSS is a  dark archive  in that it supports no online real time public access  Archived materials can be accessed only through the dissemination function  which allows authorized users to request copies to be delivered asynchronously  The standard dissemination package consists of the content as originally submitted along with the latest  best  version of any file  if different  Although DAITSS can ingest any type of material  it is particularly well suited to ETDs because it is totally independent of any submission and access systems implemented by the university  Schools can use their own cataloging  search  access and presentation services for their online ETDs  or they can rely on ProQuest UMI s digital collection  For preservation  they would send a copy of the ETD file s  along with a METS format descriptor to DAITSS  If for any reason the online copy was threatened by the obsolescence of a file format  the school would request dissemination of the current version of the master ETD from DAITSS  This would be used to replace or re generate the online version  FCLA has a commitment to the Institute of Museum and Library Services  IMLS   which partially funded DAITSS development  to make the application widely known and freely available  We anticipate releasing the system under an open source license for implementation and broader co development in calendar 2005  The system is designed to make it easy to distribute the development of format classes  which means that as the number of DAITSS implementations and developers increases  the number of formats it will be able to handle for full preservation should increase proportionately  Although other options are available as described above  FCLA believes the marketplace for digital preservation services and tools benefits from the additional choice of using DAITSS  FCLA wants to make DAITSS known to the international community and ETD institutions as an option in their preservation planning  Libraries who might be interested in
