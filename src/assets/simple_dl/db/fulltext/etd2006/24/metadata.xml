Technology Bombay is an academic and research institution set up in 1958  is a very special institute offering programs of higher learning that are awarding degrees offering research programmes  in engineering  technology and science  IITB accepts consultancy assignments and sponsored projects are of prime importance  The objectives of the institute are  training  leadership  organize educational programmes  interact with industrial national international professional bodies  research capabilities and offer consultancy to industry  Guiding philosophy behind these objectives are  acquisition  preservation  dissemination  advancement of knowledge etc  through research both  pure and applied sciences  engineering humanities and social sciences  Reference and computer applications section of the central library plays vital role in achieving these goals of the institute  Thus  we try to maintain current developments at par with the world trends  We intend to explore the possibilities of unlocking our research output to researchers  academicians etc  We have already digitized many of our activities and presently our interests are towards enhancing digital repository of scholarly publications and make this database available to Indian national digital library in science and technology  INDEST  consortium members in India and global scholarly community  This will significantly enhance visibility of research work being carried   2 OBJECTIVES Our objectives of this study are     To bring all these intellectual work be brought under one umbrella      To

2913  Masters Dissertations   2551   Doctorate Theses 362  M  Masters Dissertations D  Doctorate Theses   Please note that in the initial stages of submission teething problems were there and some data got corrupted  We have abstract and bibliographic details of 226 data during the years 1999 2000  4 SELECTION OF SOFTWARE Our in house developed ETD software does not support the advanced search  standards and protocol like OAI PMH  After the survey of open source software  DSpace is suitable to setup IITB repository of ETDs  faculty publications  technical reports and other publications of the institute  Research institutions worldwide use DSpace as an institutional a learning object repository  for records management  and more  The DSpace open source platform is freely available so we can customize and extend it to suit our needs  The DSpace digital repository system captures  stores  indexes  preserves  and distributes digital research material  DSpace accepts all forms of digital materials including text  images  video  and audio files  Possible contents in digital repositories include e theses  journal articles  technical reports  audio files  etc  Thus  we will be able to meet variety of digital archiving needs  Moreover  INDEST members such as IIT  Delhi  Indian institute of Science  Bangalore etc have implemented Dspace  It is fairly easy to build an institutional repository with Dspace  Planning and implementing stages of DSpace are very well documented  It has strong flexible administrative and security features like e mail password based authentication  persistent identifier  handle   it provides advanced and simple search and is compliant OAI PMH protocol for metadata harvesting  We may mention here that our focus will be on post submission of ETD  journal articles  conference proceeding papers and other institute publications  5 PILOT STUDY Reference and computer application section of the central library  IITB is concerned with postsubmission activity and maintenance of ETD database  Faculties have been consulted regarding inclusion of their publications in the database  This will facilitate archival activity at the institute  As regards to contents of the pilot study  we have selected journal articles   conference proceeding papers and e theses and dissertations  The contributors would be faculty and students Infrastructure was available at the Institute and this work was not taken up as project  but was taken up as challenging work  DSpace server has been set up to carry out pilot study  Marketing of service is policy matter and yet to be decided  For pilot study  we have chosen faculty publications  journal articles   conference proceeding papers  and e theses of different departments under communities and collections  The data have been randomly selected from on line submitted dissertations theses and journal articles   conference proceeding papers  The faculty had given their agreed to add soft copies of their papers wherever they are available on e resources of our website  As per information provided by SHERPA RoMEO Publisher Copyright policies and self archiving which ever for publications are there on the site will be added to our digital repository  At present our database  5   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  comprises of on line submitted disseminations theses and journal articles and conference proceeding papers  Pilot study was successfully carried out  6 FUTURE PLANS The INDEST Consortium is the most ambitious initiative taken so far in the country  The benefit of consortia based subscription to electronic resources is not confined to 38 major technological institutions  IITs  IIM  IISC NITs  in the country but is also extended to all AICTE accredited and UGC affiliated institutions  99 engineering colleges and institutions have already joined the consortium on their own  New initiatives of INDEST consortia under  INDEST extended  proposition included esubmission of thesis and dissertation  union catalogue of books  e print archives etc  IIT Delhi  headquarters of the INDEST Consortia is in the process of setting up cross archiving and metadata harvesting services across all INDEST member institutions  Under such circumstances  it would be of great help to research community if we provide access to our scholarly publications to all INDEST member institutions under the INDEST Consortia by seeking the help of DSpace Federation  7 CONCLUSIONS We have successfully carried out pilot study of enhancing digital repository of scholarly publications using Dspace open source software  Scholarly publications include journal articles  conference proceeding papers and e theses dissertations  The issue of copyright is under consideration and senate decision is awaited  We aim to add our database in INDEST consortia and make it available to all INDEST member institutions and global community  8 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  We wish to place on record our sincere thanks to Prof  Ashok Misra  Director  Our
