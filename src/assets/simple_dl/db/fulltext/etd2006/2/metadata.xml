<fulltext>FAQ  Using a Creative Commons Copyright Licence for Learning Objects Prepared by Creative Commons Canada Licensed under a CC BY v2 5  Canada  copyright licence For more information  please visit  www creativecommons ca  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 1  What is copyright  Copyright is a form of intellectual property  IP  protected under a Canadian legal statute called the Copyright Act   Intellectual property is intended to give legal protections for products of the mind  similar to those protections available for physical property  Other categories of IP include patents  trademarks  and industrial designs  Copyright is a bundle of economic and moral rights related to the reproduction of creative works  The owner of a copyright is allowed to produce or reproduce the work in question or to permit anyone else to do so  Copyright law rewards and protects creative endeavor by giving the creator the exclusive right to use  copy and publish their work  among others  For more on copyright  please visit the Canadian Copyright Office   2  Are learning objects covered by copyright law  Yes  While names  facts  and short combinations of words are not covered under copyright  learning objects   when taken as a whole   are largely protect under copyright law  However  it is important to note that  ideas can NOT be protected by copyright  It is only the expression of ideas that are protected by copyright law  provided the expression is fixed  in time and space  and sufficiently original  3  Am I always the copyright owner for my work  While the owner of a copyright is usually the person creating the work  this may not be true if the work is created while under the employment of another party  To findout if you are the copyright owner of such works  please check your contract and review the issue with your employer  4  How long does my copyright last  Under Canadian law  your copyright will last for 50 years following the calendar year of your death  5  What are moral rights  In Canada  the author of a creative work is also granted  moral rights  in the work  at the time of creation  These rights are retained by the creator for the duration of the copyright even if the copyright is transferred to another person  Moral rights protect against the unauthorized use of the work in a way that materially distracts from its integrity and or is prejudicial to the creator s honour or reputation  6  What is fair dealing  There are occasions when unauthorized use of a copyrighted work may not amount to   infringement of the copyright  These uses are described as  fair dealing  and include partial reproduction for private study  research  criticism  review  and news reporting  Nevertheless  if a passage is republished  it must be properly attributed to the author  7  What is a deriva tiv e work  A derivative work is a work that is based on another work but is not an exact  verbatim copy  What this means exactly and comprehensively is the subject of many law journal articles and much debate and pontification  In general  a translation from one language to another or a film version of a book are examples of derivative works   IDENTIFYING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS 1  What is the purpose of creating a com m on s of learning objects  The idea is to make learning objects available under a copyright licence which gives permission to use  reuse and repurpose the work as needed in the context of education  The aim of the CC BY NC SA copyright licence is to increase the availability of Canadian content  rich learning objects and corresponding ICT skills  meeting criteria of accessibility flexibility and providing clarity about intellectual property  2  Where can I find CC BY  NC  SA  licensed learning objects  Learning objects available under an CC BY NC SA copyright licence can be found online at www creativecommons ca  3  How do I use a CC BY  NC  SA  licensed learning objects  The learning objects licensed under CC BY NC SA are available to use  reuse and repurpose free of charge  However  you need to understand what the licensing conditions for your selected object are  To do so  you simply click on the CC logo located at the bottom right of the page  4  How do I use an CC BY  NC  SA  licensed work  When using an CC BY NC SA licensed learning object  you are pre  authorized by the licensor to use the work for non  commercial educational purposes  However  before using a CC BY NC SA licensed work  you should satisfy yourself that the scope of the licence covers your intended uses  To get an understanding of the key terms of the licence  review the Commons Deed and visit the CC Canada website to learn more  5  Can I get a certificate or diplo m a from CC Canada  No  CC Canada does not grant diplomas or certificates  The learning objects are available for use  reuse and repurpose but CC does not intend to replace educational institutions  CC Canada merely serves to facilitate access to learning objects  6  What if I have a concern or want to ask a question related to the learning object I am using  Questions should be addressed directly to the author of the material  The e mail address of the author may be available together with the learning object  Some authors may also provide other means of communication  such as their telephone number    COPYRIGHT LICENSING OPTIONS  a  for Licensors 1  How do I offer a learning object under an CC BY  NC  SA copyright licence  Before applying a Creative Commons licence to a learning object  you need to make sure you have the authority to do so  To offer a work under a Creative Commons  or other  copyright licence you must be the person who owns the copyright in the work or have their permission  If the work was created during the course of employment  then your employer probably owns the rights to the work   meaning only they can decide to apply a Creative Commons licence  You should review the terms of your employment agreement to see who owns intellectual property produced in the course of employment  If you are combining works made by other people to create a derivative work or working collaboratively with other people  you need to make sure that you have the other creators  permission before offering the end result under a Creative Commons licence  2  What are the terms and conditions of an CC Attribution  In order to preserve moral rights their works every time someone makes use financial compensation  it just means that you  BY  NC  SA licence  of authors  they must be credited for of them  Attribution is not related to indicate who created the work I used   Non  Commercial  Non  commercial indicates that you can only use the licensed work for personal purposes  Non  commercial also means use by an Educational Institution or a person acting under its authority  It excludes any commercial use  including professional  political or promotional uses   If you would like to use a work for a commercial purpose  you should first contact the creator and discuss the possibility of a commercial licence  Share  Alike  This provision determines that whoever builds on an original work has to share it on the same licensing conditions of the original works  3  So  Non   Com m e rcial   means that the work cannot be used com m e rcially  Not quite  The  Non  Commercial  condition means that you do not receive the commercial rights via an CC BY NC SA licence  You can always approach the licensor directly to see if they will separately license you the commercial rights  4  What if I change my mind  CC licences are non  revocable  This means that you cannot stop someone  who has obtained your work under an CC BY NC SA licence  from using the work according to that licence  You can stop distributing your work under an CC BY NC SA licence at any time you wish  but this will not withdraw any copies of your work that already exist under an CC BY NC SA licence from circulation  be they verbatim copies  copies included in collective works and or adaptations of your work  So you need to think carefully when choosing an CC BY NC SA licence to make sure that you are comfortable with the consequences    5  Do I need to sign something or register to obtain a CC licence  No  Creative Commons does not keep track of nor register creative works that have been licensed under a Creative Commons licence  Creative Commons licences are designed for you to choose and apply them independently  Creative Commons licences are automatically binding upon people who use the work to which they are attached  this is because the Creative Commons  Some Rights Reserved  button and hyperlinked copyright licence   is deemed to provide sufficient notice of the terms and conditions to prospective users  6  What is the Com m o n s Deed  What is the legal code  What does the html   m e t a d a t a do  Creative Commons licences are expressed in three different formats  the Commons Deed  human  readable language   the Legal Code  lawyer  readable language   and the metadata  machine  readable language   The Commons Deed is a summary of the key terms and conditions of the actual copyright licence  read  Legal Code    that is  what others can and cannot do with the work  The Commons Deed itself has no legal value though its terms and conditions are synonymous with the Legal Code  The Legal Code is the actual copyright enforceable in a court of law   licence  it is drafted by lawyers and  The Machine Code is the metadata describing the key licence terms and other material details of the work  The inclusion of Machine Code allows the licence to be located and interpreted by search engines and Internet browsers  7  I don t like the way a person has used my work in a derivative work or included it in a collective work  what can I do  If you do not like the way that a person has made a derivative work or incorporated your work into a collective work  under the CC BY NC SA licence  you may request removal of your name from the derivative work or the collective work  8  What happens if someone misuses my CC  licensed work  An CC licence terminates automatically if someone uses your work contrary to the licence terms  This means that  if a person uses your work under an CC BY NC SA licence and they  for example  fail to attribute your work in the manner you specified  then they no longer have the right to continue to use your work  This only applies in relation to the person in breach of the licence  it does not apply generally to the other people who use your work under an CC BY NC SA licence and comply with its terms  You have a number of options as to how you can contacting the person and asking them to rectify consider consulting a lawyer to act on your behalf  may be able to locate a suitably qualified lawyer  society   enforce this  you can consider the situation and or you can For information about how you please contact your local law  9  Will CC Canad a help me enforce my licence  Unfortunately  CC Canada is not able to provide legal advice or legal services to assist   you with enforcing the licences  We are not a law firm  10  Can I still make money from a work I make available under an CC BY  NC  SA licence  Absolutely  The non  commercial licence option is an inventive tool designed to allow people to maximize the distribution of their works while keeping control of the commercial aspects of their copyright  An CC licence is non  exclusive  which means you are not restricted to only offering the learning object under an CC BY NC SA licence  you can also enter into other revenue  generating licences in relation to your work  To make one thing clear that is sometimes misunderstood  the  noncommercial use  condition applies only to others who use your work  not to you  the licensor   By offering your work under an CC BY NC SA copyright licence  you impose the  noncommercial  condition on the users  licencees   However  you  the creator of the work and or licensor  may at any time decide to use it commercially  People who want to copy or adapt your work   primarily for monetary compensation or financial gain  must get your separate permission first  11  Do I need to register my copyright in order to use an CC licence  No  Copyrights do not need to be registered  As soon as the work is fixed in a medium  you become the owner of the copyright  For example  the moment you put pen to paper  print a photograph or record a song  the copyright in the work is owned by the creator  While copyrights can be registered with the Canadian Copyright Office   this is not required to prove ownership  12  Do I need a copyright notice to protect my work  You do not need to make use of a copyright notice to secure copyright protection  However  a copyright notice can be useful because it clearly signals to people that you believe you own copyright in your work  what the terms and conditions of its use are  if any  and who to contact for further information  13  Are CC licences enforcea ble in a court of law  The CC BY NC SA Legal Code has been drafted with the intention that it will be enforceable in court  However  we cannot predict how different courts across Canada will react to a certain provision  The CC BY NC SA licence contains  severability  clauses    meaning that  if a certain provision is found to be unenforeceable in a certain place  that provision and only that provision drops out of the licence  leaving the rest of the agreement intact    b  for Licensees 1  Does using an CC BY  NC  SA  licensed work give me all the rights I need  You should be aware that the CC BY NC SA licence contains a disclaimer of warranties  so there is no assurance whatsoever that the licensor has all the necessary rights to permit reuse of the licensed work  The disclaimer means that the licensor is not guaranteeing anything about the work  including that he she owns the copyright to it  or that he she has cleared any uses of third  party content that his her work may be based on or incorporate  This is typical where works are made widely   and freely available for reuse at no charge  However  warranties and indemnities are best determined by private bargain  so that each licensor and licensee can determine the appropriate allocation of risk and reward for their unique situation  One option then would be to use private contract to obtain a warranty and indemnification from the licensor  although it is likely that the licensor would charge for this benefit  2  How do I properly attribute an CC BY  NC  SA  licensed work  When using a work under an CC BY NC SA licence  the proper way of accrediting is   1  to keep intact any copyright notices for the Work   2  credit the author  licensor and or other parties  such as a wiki or journal  in the manner they specify   3  the title of the Work  and  4  the Uniform Resource Identifier for the work if specified by the author and or licensor  You also need to provide the Uniform Resource Locator for the CC licence with each copy of the work that you make available  3  If I use an CC BY  NC  SA  licensed work with other works  do I have to license everything else on the same terms  Yes  Because of the way that the ShareAlike licence element operates  the resultant work will need to be licensed under the same licence as the original work  If you include an CC BY NC SA licensed work in a  collective work   ie  a collection of works in their exact original format  not adaptations   then you only need to continue to apply the CC BY NC SA licence to that work  You do not need to apply it to the entire collection  4  What happens if I want to mak e a different use of the work  If you want to use an CC BY NC SA licensed work in a manner that is not permitted under the terms of the CC BY NC SA licence  you need to contact the creator and or licensor and ask for their permission  If you use an CC BY NC SA licensed work contrary to the terms of the CC BY NC SA licence  your right to use the work terminates and you could be sued for infringement of copyright  5  Can I combine two different CC BY  NC  SA  licensed works  Can I combine an CC BY  NC  SA  licensed work with another work  Generally yes  However  an CC BY NC SA licence contains a ShareAlike condition  This requires derivative works  ie  the result of two works combined  to be licensed under the same licence elements  If you are combining a work licensed under CC BY NC SA with another work  you need to make sure that you are able to license the resulting work under an CC BY NC SA licence    COPYRIGHT LICENSING FOR LEARNING OBJECTS  Marcu s Bo rnfre un d  This presentation is
