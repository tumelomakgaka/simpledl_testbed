THE REJECTION OF D SPACE  SELECTING THESES DATABASE SOFTWARE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY ARCHIVES Lisa Atkinson  University of Calgary  Canada lisa atkinson ucalgary ca 1  INTRODUCTION This paper presents the results of a recent University of Calgary Archives project to investigate the replacement of our existing theses and dissertations database  In collaboration with the University Library s Information Technologies department the Archives undertook a pilot project aimed at replacing the existing descriptive database and expanding on its capabilities by implementing D Space as an institutional repository for electronic theses and dissertations  Ultimately D Space was rejected as a viable option for housing our theses database  although the software is still used by the University for its Institutional Repository which contains other forms of scholarly output by the university s academic community  The Archives has since selected another software program for its theses database which I will provide details of later in this paper  This project to replace our theses database was part of a larger initiative to establish an electronic theses program at the University of Calgary  Due to time constraints my comments here will focus only on our findings in regards to D Space but I would be happy to discuss the e theses program later if anyone is interested   2  THE CONTEXT I wanted to start off this paper by putting my comments about our experiences with D Space at the University of Calgary into context particularly for those of you from outside Canada who may never have heard of Calgary  let alone know anything about the city or its university  Calgary is located in western Canada within the province of Alberta  about 300 kilometres north of the Canada United States border  and about 100 kilometres east of Banff National Park in the Rocky Mountains  The University of Calgary is a relatively young institution   it was established as an autonomous  degree granting institution in 1966 though its roots date back to 1905  It is a medicaldoctoral university offering professional programs in engineering  law  medicine  nursing  social work  environmental design and  beginning in 2007  veterinary medicine  It has 16 faculties  53 departments  and over 30 research institutes and centres  In 2005 2006 the University had approximately 28 000 full time equivalent students  including 5 300 graduate students  Some of these graduate students are engaged in programs which are course based and do not include a thesis element  Currently  between 550 and 600 theses and dissertations are completed annually  and in 2005 the theses collection contained approximately 13 000 titles  The University Archives is responsible for preserving and making available this collection of original theses which is recognized on campus as representing a significant portion of the research output of the institution  The University Library holds microfiche copies of the majority of the theses held in the Archives  and it also has a large collection of bound theses which researchers can take out on loan   3  CAVEATS In coming to this conference to talk about electronic theses generally and about D Space more specifically  I am somewhat uncomfortably aware that I am likely speaking to an already converted   audience  that many of you are convinced of the benefits of both e theses and of this software  Certainly  in preparing for this talk it became clear to me that there are numerous universities across the world that have chosen to use D Space to make their electronic theses available to researchers  I noted however that D Space does not have a total stranglehold on the market  but that there are universities that are using or proposing to use something other than D Space for their electronic theses databases 1 So perhaps there are those of you who have found like we did that D Space is lacking some elements essential to your specific requirements  and perhaps others who are still in the process of weighing the available options for their e theses repository software  My comments about D Space come with a couple of caveats  Firstly  the IT department of the Library  in hearing that I was proposing to give this talk on our experiences  informed me that the version of D Space we used during our pilot project is not the most recent version now available  It is possible that the current version of D Space offers some of the functions I found it lacked when we undertook our research on it  I don t think that is the case  I didn t find anything online when I was preparing this paper that was more fully functional than the version we were using  but you should nonetheless be aware of that consideration 2 Secondly  to clarify  this project was interdisciplinary in nature  involving specialists from information technologies and from the Archives  The Library s IT department was responsible for configuring DSpace to the Archives  specifications and for providing us with technical support and information on the capabilities of D Space  The Archives  as the creator and user of the database  was responsible for determining how the data in D Space should be configured  Once data had been migrated  the Archives was also responsible for determining whether the system s technical capabilities measured up to the requirements we have in performing our day to day activities vis a vis the theses collection  I therefore can answer for the aspects of the project the Archives was responsible for  but not those that fell into the domain of IT   4  WHY D SPACE  So how did the University of Calgary Archives come to contemplate using D Space to make its theses available to researchers  Since about 1998 the University Archives had had an online theses database  which contained descriptions of the theses in our holdings  The database was available on the internet and researchers worldwide were able to search it to find theses that were relevant to their work  No digital copies of the theses were attached to the descriptions  but researchers had a number of options available to them to access content which were explicitly stated on the theses website  Some months ago  this public database ceased functioning  It was soon clear to the Archives that our clients wanted access to this resource and there was pressure to replace it quickly  To complicate the issue  the theses database was only one module of a suite of software programs used in the Archives to control its large collection of permanent holdings  and to manage active and semi active records on 1  Content DM  for example  is being proposed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  and other institutions such as the Universities of Saskatchewan and Waterloo  the Australasian digital theses program and the universities that take part in that program are using still other products   2  During the discussion following the presentation of this paper  a conference delegate indicated that the most recent version of D Space has addressed only some of the display issues that I identify in this paper  The majority of my criticisms of the software were supported and confirmed by other delegates who are currently using D Space in their institutions  2   campus through the Archives  records management program  This software had been in use since 1996 and was also in need of replacement  though not urgently  Due to the complexity of our database requirements we recognized that selecting new software would be quite time consuming so we were open to other options for making the theses records available online  At about the same time the idea of developing an Institutional Repository at the University of Calgary was gaining support amongst some upper level administrators  The Information Technology department of the University Library   which is in the same administrative division as the University Archives   had selected D Space as the Institutional Repository software for the campus and was actively seeking participation in this initiative  It was suggested that migrating the theses data from its defunct database into D Space would be an easy solution to the Archives  problem of replacing the public theses database quickly  At the same time importing 13 000 records into D Space would help promote the institutional repository initiative by showing the university community what D Space could do  and would potentially help to encourage the development of an electronic theses program on campus as well   5  TESTING RECORDS IN D SPACE 5 1 Migrating Records Discussions amongst the Library s IT Department and the University Archives therefore quickly got underway to determine how to go about migrating records from the existing theses database into D Space  D Space required some tailoring by IT staff in order to add fields that we wished to retain from our former system  to rename existing fields to more closely reflect their content and to incorporate some data entry modifications that the Archives requested  Eventually about 450 theses records were migrated to DSpace to serve as a test collection on which we would examine the searching and reporting functionalities of the system  Our testing uncovered shortcomings in a number of areas that eventually led to our rejection of D Space as viable database software for our theses collection  5 2 Searching Issues The most significant issues we found were related to the very limited search capabilities of D Space  DSpace offers a basic search through which researchers can choose either keyword searching  or browsing by title  author or date  In testing the theses data we first attempted to search by date in an effort to pull up all the theses completed in a specific year  We require this information when reporting annually on the number of theses added to the collection for insurance purposes  However we found that the D Space software does not allow a  search  of a specific date to be made  but rather offers only a date  browse   When date browsing  we found that D Space pulls up all theses in the database and highlights those that are relevant to the year requested   See Figure 1  An accurate count of theses for a particular year is therefore not given   rather  the count is of the entire database  In order to produce an accurate figure for our reporting purposes it would therefore be necessary for us to conduct a manual count of the items in the system for a specific year  In an effort to circumvent the  browse  issue  we conducted a basic search for the date  1960  in hopes of pulling up all the theses completed in that year  Unfortunately this technique resulted in numerous hits that were not relevant to our intended inquiry as shown in Figure 2  D Space does not clearly indicate to researchers what fields are being searched through its basic  search  mechanism but it would appear to be conducting a keyword search of multiple fields  When we investigated the search results more closely we found that a number of items had  1960  in the subject fields  for example  Camus  Albert   1913 1960   as shown in the detailed record for this 1978 thesis  See Figure 3    3   Figure 1  Browsing by Date   Figure 2  Basic Search results for  1960    4   Figure 3  Detailed record for  1960  search result  Again  we were unable to receive an accurate count of the number of theses that exist in the system for a specific year  and a manual count would be required in order to obtain the information we require for insurance reporting purposes  D Space also offers an advanced search which allows up to three fields to be searched at one time  This advanced search has nine fields to choose from  which are pre set for the whole of D Space and cannot be configured to suit individual collections within it  We found that several of these pre set fields are not relevant to the theses records in our database  so we were left with only 4 fields to choose from for an advanced search  including  keyword    author    title  and  subject   Fields that are critical to effective searching of the theses collection were not offered  including  date    supervisor    department  and  degree   Consequently  although the advanced search does increase the viability of searching in D Space by allowing more than one search term to be used  we found that it is not sophisticated enough to allow us to conduct searches which will satisfy our researchers  needs and our own reporting requirements  I have a couple of examples to illustrate our difficulties  Firstly  the University Archives reports annually to Petroleum Abstracts on theses pertaining to the upstream oil industry that have been added to our collection during the previous year  In order to do this we need to be able to search on two fields at a minimum and preferably three  a date  i e  2005  and a department  i e  Geology and Geophysics  or History  or Law   a date and a keyword  i e   oil    petroleum  etc   or a date  a department and a keyword  Date and Department fields are not available in the advanced search tool  Using the keyword field to search for the desired date and department yields results that are not relevant to our intended inquiry  since the software hits on the specified keywords in fields other than date and department  A second example  researchers frequently come to the Archives wanting to look at the theses that a certain department and or supervisor has produced for specific years and  within that group of theses  for specific degrees and subjects  Such searches may require as many as four or five different fields to be searched at one time  i e  Degree  Department  Year  Supervisor  Subject  D Space will not allow this level of sophistication in searching   we cannot search on more than 3 fields and we cannot search on many of the fields we need to be able to in order to receive relevant hits  Four of these five fields are not included as options in the advanced search tool  We also found that D Space would not allow us to search for a type of degree   either as a field specific search or as a keyword  Our attempts at searching 5   for  M Sc   and  Ph D   were unsuccessful  see figure 4  even though items with these degrees exist in the test collection  see figure 5    Figure 4  Searching for degree type   Figure 5  MSc thesis full metadata record  5 3 Reporting Issues Other problems we found with D Space functionality related to the reporting capabilities of the software  In attempting to print the details of items in D Space we found that the system does not allow us to conduct a search  choose a number of items from the hit list and then print a report containing details of the chosen hits  Instead  individual entries need to be clicked on to show the desired level of report  either the short or long version    and then printed off one at a time  a somewhat cumbersome process at best  Our researchers often want printed reports of relevant theses that they can take away with them  we have been able to provide this service in the past and would ideally want to retain that capability  A second shortcoming in the reporting capabilities that we found is that D Space will not allow us to choose selected entries from a search results list  save them and then e mail them in a report to clients as an electronic attachment  We found that it is possible to save individual entries and attach those  but again this is a somewhat arduous process when dealing with numerous items at one time  Our office regularly  6   uses electronic reports when communicating with Petroleum Abstracts about potential additions to their records of our holdings  and also when responding to reference requests from clients  It is therefore very useful for us to be able to save relevant hits from a search in a single report   we were disappointed that D Space will not allow this functionality  We also found that it is not possible to move from the detailed report of one item on the hit list directly to the detailed report of the next item  Instead  it is necessary to drill down from the hit list to a report of each item  then retreat to the hit list and drill down again for details of the next item  This tends to be rather slow  particularly if one needs to consult the detailed report which is two screens beyond the hit list  Our final complaint regarding D Space s reporting capabilities is that the software does not contain the option to sort the hits in a search results list  Our office has been able to sort search results by any field in our former system  i e  Date  Supervisor  Author  Title etc  This is a useful function which allows us to group together records for researchers based on their interests and priorities  The lack of this function will prove arduous for researchers who wish to arrange the data to suit their requirements  particularly in cases where there are long search result lists   5 4 Administrative and Display Issues Our staff was also unhappy with the fact that D Space does not allow both administrative and public views of the database  Our database contains information that is required for administrative use in house  but which we do not wish to show in the public view   i e  physical location  barcodes and notes on processing issues that are awaiting resolution  Ideally therefore  we require separate public and in house views in order to administer the collection effectively while presenting clients only with the information they require to access the records they need  Our choice with D Space would appear to be between two imperfects  either show data that the public does not need and perhaps ought not to have access to  or maintain a separate system containing the data we do not wish to make public   Figure 6  Full metadata record  unattractive  confusing and counterintuitive  In general our staff felt that the display of information in D Space is confusing and unattractive  This is particularly true of the full metadata report where there is a lot of information that users do not need to be 7   concerned with and fields that are oddly named and confusing to the layman  see figure 6   The data is also arranged in a manner that is almost counter intuitive  In the full metadata record the title and degree type appear at the bottom of the page while less pertinent information about the item such as when the data was added to the system appears at the top of the report   6  FINAL THOUGHTS ON D SPACE Finally  we were concerned that many of the problems we found with the functionality of the software might be expected to increase correspondingly as the volume of entries in D Space increased  We were uncomfortably aware that the test collection contained only 450 theses  The theses database that was being considered for migration to D Space had more than 13 000 titles  What impact would migrating the entire database and then adding 600 new titles annually have on the functionality of the program and our ability to effectively use it to manage our theses collection  In reflecting on our findings  it strikes me that we were possibly being unfair in our analysis of the DSpace software   we were perhaps asking it to perform a role larger than it was designed to fill  However  even if we discount our issues with the lack of an administrative view and the limited reporting functions  D Space still scores very poorly in its searching capabilities  Of all aspects to consider when selecting a database  the ability to effectively retrieve the information contained within it is surely the most important  When the University Archives was offered D Space as a  quick fix  to our desire to make our online theses database available quickly  we seized it too eagerly  With hindsight  we should perhaps have spent some time in careful consideration of how the theses collection could best be managed  If the move towards electronic theses is a permanent one  how will we who are charged with preserving these items effectively handle a large collection that exists only in paper form on the one hand  and an electronic theses collection which may or may not exist also in paper format on the other   both of which we wish to make publicly available  Above all there is clearly a need to ensure that there is no duplication of effort  Theses are already extremely time consuming to process  Running parallel systems for accessing the paper and electronic theses is not a viable option  In replacing its database programs  the University Archives selected a program that we feel will effectively manage both our paper and electronic theses   7  THESES DATABASE SOFTWARE SELECTED AT UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES As I indicated earlier  our former theses database formed part of a suite of archival databases which contained 3 modules  Theses  Archives and Records Management  The Archives has selected WebGencat for our new database system 3 The Library module of this program has been adopted for our theses database  It has not been fully tailored yet  but I will show you some screenshots from it anyway to give you a sense of how it looks and functions  WebGencat allows both administrative  or librarian  and public displays  so we will be able to show only those fields we wish clients to see in the public display  keeping administrative information confidential for use in house only  Figure 7 shows the various options that are available for searching in both the administrative and public views   3  WebGencat is the creation of Eloquent Systems Inc  located in Vancouver  Canada  http   www eloquent systems com    8   Figure 7  Librarian and Public view options WebGencat will allow searches to be conducted on multiple fields at one time  Figure 8 shows the public template search screen and Figure 9 shows the public advanced search option   Figure 8  Public template search screen  untailored    9   Figure 9  Public advanced search screen  untailored  Figure 10 shows a list of hits in the public template search on the left side of the screen with details of a selected hit on the right  Multiple  hits  can be selected for printing in a single report or for saving in various formats  including pdf  to send electronically to clients   Figure 10  Search results   public template search Figure 11 shows selected hits on the right and reporting options on the left   this is shown in the administrative view  but the public also has most of these options in the public view  Electronic documents can be linked to an entry so we will be equipped to offer users an online search tool with electronic copies of theses attached   10   Figure 11  Administrative view  multiple hits selected for a report  Reporting options are on the left of the screen  WebGencat is a more sophisticated database than D Space and it more closely meets the needs of the University Archives in all aspects of its functionality  It offers us more control over the data in the database in all areas of administration  reference and reporting  We also feel that the display is more appealing and user friendly than we found D Space to be  We hope to have the software fully tailored in the near future and our public database back online   11   </fulltext>
