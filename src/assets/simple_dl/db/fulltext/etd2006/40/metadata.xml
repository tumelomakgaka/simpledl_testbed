ELETRONIC THESES ONLINE SERVICE  EThOS    A NATIONAL UK PROJECT  Martin Wolf  University of Warwick  M Wolf warwick ac uk  1  INTRODUCTION This paper outlines the background and work to date of the Electronic Theses Online Service  EThOS  project  The project s aim is to create  a working  scaleable prototype national service  for the UK  The EThOS service  which will be implemented from the prototype service  will enhance access to the UK s body of doctoral theses by providing a single Web based service through which users can access theses that are both born digital and digitised from hardcopy format  Information about the project will be presented in the following sections    Project background and approach   this outlines the current situation in the UK with regards to accessing doctoral theses  and how the EThOS project was established    Proposals and achievements   this outlines the proposals for a national e Theses service and the project s achievements so far    Next steps   this outlines what further steps are necessary to reach the goal of a prototype service   2  PROJECT BACKGROUND AND APPROACH 2 1 Access To Doctoral Theses In The UK At Present Current access to doctoral theses in the UK can be a lengthy and cumbersome process  This process is summarised below  1  an end user first identifies the thesis they want  from personal recommendations  references in other papers  catalogues and indexing databases  etc    2  the end user makes an Inter Library Loan request for the item at their home institution  assuming they know this is possible   3  the requesting institution s library must search for the thesis  4  the requesting institution s library must then request the thesis either from the British Library or directly from the thesis  originating institution  5  the British Library must locate the thesis then prepare a copy to be sold at cost to the requesting institution  cost dependant on whether the thesis is to be supplied as a bound photocopy or on microfilm    alternatively  the originating institution must locate the item and make a decision on whether or not to loan the item  6  the item is then mailed to the requesting institution  who either absorb the cost of making the request  or pass that cost on to the researcher  This whole procedure can take up to 6 weeks  and involves a great deal of expensive administrative work on the part of requesting institutions  supplying institutions and the British Library  which administers the current service  For this reason  web based alternatives to the delivery of UK doctoral theses are being pursued   2 2 EThOS And Previous E Theses Projects In The UK The Joint Information Systems Committee  JISC  is a UK wide body that supports the use of information and communications technology by further and higher education institutions  funded by all the UK s post 16 education funding councils  It funds research projects that are   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  grouped together by common themes into research programmes  One such programme  the FAIR programme  Focus on Access to Institutional Resources   funded three separate projects looking at different aspects of e Theses  These were    Electronic Theses   based at The Robert Gordon University  this project explored methods of e Theses production  management and use  in order to produce recommended models to encourage the take up of e Theses by UK education    DAEDALUS   based at University of Glasgow  this project examined using different software solutions  for example  GNU eprints and DSpace  for storing and delivering different information types  e Theses  e prints  grey literature  etc      Theses Alive    based at University of Edinburgh  this project examined the software requirements for creating online theses submissions systems  and for creating additional functionality  specific to e Theses  for repository software  The EThOS project is bringing these different strands together into one project  The three institutions mentioned above are all involved in EThOS  with University of Glasgow acting as lead institution   The aim of the project is to create a working  scaleable prototype national service for UK e Theses  The main distinguishing elements of the EThOS project are    investigation of the digitisation of current print theses in addition to the storage and delivery of new theses created in a digital format  the prototype service envisaged will therefore provide access on demand to digitised versions of print theses  as well as born digital theses     creation of a  toolkit  that will provide detailed practical advice to aid institutions in establishing Institutions Repositories and contributing to the EThOS service  for further details  see Susan Copeland s conference paper The  EThOS  Toolkit   The project began in January 2005  though only began in earnest upon the appointment of a full time Project Manager in May 2005  The project is set to be completed in September 2006   2 3 Who Is Involved In The EThOS Project  The sponsors and funders of the project include the JISC  50  of funds  and CURL  Consortium of Research Libraries in the British Isles   The rest of the project s funds come from the partner institutions  The partner institutions have a broad range of experience  In addition to the universities mentioned above  there are other universities with experience of eTheses  e g  Cranfield University  and those with no prior experience with e Theses  e g  University of Warwick   The British Library and the National Library of Wales are also heavily involved  having made significant contributions to the management and technical development of several aspects of the project   2 4 How Is The EThOS Project Being Managed  The project is being guided by a Project Board  On the board are leaders of some of the EThOS work packages  see below   the JISC project officer  and representatives of the stakeholder groups such as senior academics  university administrators and postgraduate students  A full time Project Manager is in charge of managing the day to day running of the project  This is a complicated task given the range of separate elements the project is investigating  technical  legal  procedural  etc   and the geographically dispersed nature of the institutions involved in the project    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  The work has been split into 8 separate work packages  each led by one or two institutions  but often involving collaboration with other project partners  These work packages are summarised in the table below

technology considerations  and institutional considerations  the project has devised a series of proposals for a prototype national e Theses service  In summary  it is proposed that  1  the service will provide a server  known as the Central Hub  to be located at the British Library   this server will host e Theses deposited by institutions who have no Institutional Repository of their own  or who would welcome the opportunity to store copies of their e Theses in more than one location  2  there will be an EThOS harvester which will harvest metadata and e Theses from Institutional Repositories  Consortia Repositories  and other sources of theses bibliographic data  it is hoped the service will eventually hold information on all UK doctoral theses  whether in print or electronic format   3  end users will search the EThOS web based service  locate details of theses they want and then order them  4  if the thesis the end user requires is already available in an electronic format  held either on the Central Hub or the relevant Institutional Consortia Repository  it will be available for immediate download   if not  the thesis will be requested from the   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  originating institution  digitised by the EThOS service  and uploaded to the Central Hub for end user download  5  additionally  end users can ask for theses to be supplied in a range of physical formats  loose leaf  soft bound  hardbound  CD DVD    they would be charged for supply in these alternate formats on a cost recovery basis  Regardless of whether a theses is held on the Central Hub or on an Institutional Consortia Repository  the EThOS web service will be able to deliver the required thesis to the end user  who has to search only one resource  The proposed service envisages the theses available as being either born digital or scanned and digitised from hardcopies  Digitisation of hardcopy theses could be undertaken either by the theses  originating institution  or by the EThOS service  The degree of Open Access  here defined as the free supply of intellectual content to the enduser  to the electronic version of a thesis will largely be determined by the thesis  originating institution  as explained in the next section   3 2 Service sustainability A cost recovery model is necessary in order to sustain the service administration and infrastructure  and fund the digitisation of theses currently available only in hardcopy at the library of the originating institution  In order to maintain a viable service  the following model is proposed  1  The service will be run on a cost recovery only basis  i e  the service will not be forprofit  2  Participating universities will be offered a choice of two participation options  Sponsor and Associate  a  Sponsor institutions would pay EThOS an annual subscription  Funds from this payment will be used to digitise theses from that institution in response to requests from end users  If the cost of digitising requested theses during a year exceeds the subscription payment  Sponsors can choose either to fund the additional digitisation  or charge the costs of digitisation to the end user  If the cost of on demand digitisation is lower than the yearly subscription  the institution can then choose to have digitised further theses from their collections  up to the value of the subscription payment  Once a thesis has been digitised it would be freely available to any other user of the service  b  Associate institutions would pay for the digitisation of theses in response to requests from end users on a piecemeal basis  for example monthly or quarterly   with no upfront subscription fee  Again  once a thesis has been digitised it would be freely available to any other user of the service  3  Additionally  the core services of metadata and or content upload to the Central Hub  and metadata harvesting  will be open to all UK universities for no charge  This service sustainability model provides a flexible set of options both to end users  who can select the most appropriate supply format for their purposes  and to participating universities  who have the option to determine if their theses will be available on an Open Access basis  The proposed model represents a fundamental shift from the present situation  where it is the end user institution requesting a thesis that pays for its supply  to one where the costs can  if they choose  be borne by the institution supplying a thesis  It is expected that  given the reduction in staff time and administration costs to which the proposed service should lead  overall costs of access to thesis content should remain static  or be reduced    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium

a prototype national e Theses service for the UK of the kind outlined above  These are detailed below  1  Creation of a standard for UK e Theses metadata A qualified version of Dublin Core  these standards should ensure maximum interoperability and consistency between repositories holding data on UK e Theses  2  An Intellectual Property Rights report and resultant risk management strategy The project investigated Intellectual Property Rights  IPR  in two major areas   the IPR in third party material  data  images  text  etc   used within theses  and the IPR in the theses themselves  does IPR lie with the author or the author s institution    It concluded that while to digitise a hardcopy theses without first obtaining the author s consent is a breach of copyright  to search for and obtain such permission for every digitised thesis would place an insurmountable strain on the proposed service  As such  it is proposed to digitise theses without first obtaining permission  with procedures in place for fast take down should authors object to their work being made available in this way  3  Model end user and deposit licences The IPR work package has also produced model licences both for the end users of the proposed EThOS service  setting out what can and cannot be done with the content  and those institutions contributing content and or metadata to the service  These licences will also be available for institutions to adapt to meet the needs of their own Institutional Repositories  4  Standards and procedures for digitisation Standards for digitisation have been developed  It is most likely that an in house digitisation studio at the British Library will provide the most cost  and time effective digitisation of theses  This will be investigated further as part of the evaluation of the project  see Next Steps  below   5  Harvesting interface and mechanisms The technical infrastructure for the harvesting of UK e Theses metadata has been developed and tested  Standard procedures for participating institutions  outlining requirements for exposure of metadata  folder and file conventions  etc   have been produced  6  Core Central Hub system built and ingest mechanisms working The hardware infrastructure for hosting e Theses metadata and content has been fully tested and configured  The full application is currently being developed  Mechanisms for ingesting e Theses into the Central Hub have also been fully tested and are working  7  Advocacy activities The project has been promoted through various methods  including press releases to the national education press  features in the professional literature  announcements on the mailing lists of stakeholder groups  such as the National Postgraduate Committee and the Association of University Administrators   and a successful promotional workshop    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires

of a prototype national service for access to UK doctoral theses  There is still a small number of steps that need to be taken before the project s end  These include  1  An evaluation of the project The initial EThOS plan submitted to the JISC included provision for an independent evaluation of the project  to ensure the proposed service meets the needs of the UK higher education community  This evaluation will take place  and is due to report  in summer 2006  2  Finalisation of end user interface Design of the look and feel of the eventual service to be rolled out to end users is ongoing  3  Possible involvement in future projects The JISC has issued a call for projects investigating large scale digitisation material currently only available in hardcopy format  It is possible the British Library may bid for funds to digitise a large number of print theses  If successful  such a mass digitisation could provide a useful critical mass of content to kick start the prototype service  4  Further advocacy events Two future awareness raising advocacy events before the end of the project s lifecycle are planned  Responsibility for promotion of the eventual prototype service  and the handover of advocacy from the project to the service  needs to be finalised  5  Finalisation of the EThOS toolkit The EThOS toolkit will be an interactive set of tools  accessed through a Web browser  that will provide institutions with all the information they would need in order to participate in the service  This will include elements such as the metadata standards required and the model end user and deposit licences  Additionally it will contain advice on elements such as how best to ensure engagement with e Theses at a senior level within institutions  and model procedures for moving towards mandatory submission of theses in electronic format  Further information on the toolkit is given in the paper The EThOS toolkit by Susan Copeland   6  CONCLUSION This paper has outlined the main features of the Electronic Theses Online Service project  It has covered    the background and structure of the project    the project s proposals for a future UK national e Theses service and its achievements to date    the steps necessary to move from a project to a live prototype service  The project is well on track to deliver a workable  scaleable prototype national e Theses service for the UK by September 2006  It is expected that a live service will be launched  subject to infrastructure developments at the British Library  in 2007    9th International Symposium on Electronic
