ETD2006 Conference Developing an E theses Collection in the CityU Institutional Repository Philip Wong City University of Hong Kong Library lbphilip cityu edu hk ABSTRACT This paper presents the background and process the CityU Library builds the E theses collection in the institutional repository  Like many institutions  E theses is not a new product in the CityU Library  Also like many institutions  the demand for a creating a new platform goes up when the limited functions and weak interface of the old system no longer meet the needs of users  Recently  the Library developed the university s IR  It is found that IR is an ideal platform for housing the E theses collection  IR provides a centralized place for preserving and distributing the quality student works  It can expose the academic works to the Internet via OAI PMH  The visibility gained will help the Library to obtain approval from authors to digitize and distribute their old theses  From the perspective of building IR  adding E theses to IR gives a boost to its content and will help to promote IR to the academic communities of the university  Keywords  ETD  institutional repository  digital libraries  open access  DSpace  1  INTRODUCTION Like many institutions  E theses or ETD  Electronic Theses and Dissertations  is not something new but exists for a while in the City University of Hong Kong  CityU  Library  The Library began its digitization project of theses and dissertation in 2002 and launched the existing E theses collection in 2004  The interface of the existing E theses collection consists of browse lists created from the theses records downloaded from the online library catalog  Metadata details and links to the abstract and full text remain in the catalog records  One drawback of distributing E theses through online library catalog is that the searching capability is limited by the vendor software  Besides  maintaining browse pages is a labor intensive job  In 2005 the Library began to study and develop the university s institutional repository  It was found that the enhanced searching and browsing features of the repository  and its compliancy to the OAI PMH protocol make it the ideal place to house a new E theses collection  It can also help to solve a long term accessing problem  Due to some unclear access right policies in the past  a large volume of old theses cannot be opened for academic exchange or to the public  By publicizing their research outputs in the repository  authors of past theses are given a chance to see the value of information sharing and would be willing to grant the right to digitize their works for wider access  From the perspective of building IR  adding thousands of E theses records to IR will give a boost to the content  The increased usage and collections will help the growth and promotion    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et

Hong Kong  She was found in 1984 as the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong and upgraded to a self accrediting university in 1994  There are three faculties  four schools  one division and one community college  Courses offered cover subjects in Humanities  Social Sciences  Science  Engineering  Law and Creative Media  Degrees conferred include doctoral  master  bachelor and associate degrees  In the academic year of 2005 06  there are 16 000 full time students and 9 500 part time students  CityU is one of the top ranked institutions in the world in research and teaching  The University is also a pioneer in integrating information technology into teaching  learning  and research  The CityU Library was established in the same year of the University  In 2004 05 the Library has reached a collection of more than 844 200 volumes of books and 179 800 volumes of bound periodicals  It is holding 3 800 print serials titles and subscribes to over 50 000 E book titles  The integrated library system is INNOPAC  The citation linking software is SFX  There are 19 professional staff and about 90 supporting staff  CityU Library is one of the busiest libraries in the region  In regular semester time  the Library is opened until 1 00 am  The number of entrance in 2004 05 reached 1 85 millions  The high usage and limited space have created a strong demand for electronic resources and the digital collections   3  EXISTING E THESES COLLECTION 3 1 Features Of Existing E theses As pointed out by many  the provision of E theses has significant advantages for students  faculty  staff  and the institution as a whole  students can learn more about IT skills and copyright in the process of creating the thesis  electronic copies are likely to be read and be cited more widely  scholarly outputs of the institution can be more widely distributed and the research profile of the whole institution can be promoted  RGU Library  2006   To unlock this scholarly asset  there has been international and national effort to promote the creation and sharing of e theses 1 CityU s theses and dissertation collection includes papers dated back to 1990  As of 2006 there are 1200 research postgraduate theses  Ph D  and M Phil   and 1300 taught postgraduate dissertations of other degree types  The Library began the digitization project of theses in 2002  In 2003  the School of Graduate Studies required the submission of electronic copy of Ph D  and M Phil  theses along with the print copy  In line with this new electronic submission requirement  the Library launched the first and existing E theses collection  The existing E theses collection is built around the online library catalog  MARC records are created for the print copies when they are deposited to the Library  Records can be searched by author  title  subject and keyword  Online links to the abstract and full text are provided by adding tag 856  To add browsing capability  records are extracted from the online catalog and sorted by titles  degrees and departments  Most users of E theses start from the browse lists   Figure 1   1  Examples include NTLTD  Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations

Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 1  Browsing by title in the existing E theses collection  3 2 Need For A New Platform While the browse lists are helpful  features like keyword searching in abstract are still missing  Constructing the browse lists on a regular basis also creates heavy work load on the technical support team  There are other needs to look for a new platform for the E theses  A good E theses collection is more than a subset of online catalog records  It is part of the research strength of the institution  It should be made more accessible to the users  Its design and interface should be in line with other digital collections    4  INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY 4 1 Why Created IR The Library began the CityU IR project in 2004  One motive of building the IR is to support the strategic goal of enhancing knowledge management in the campus  As proposed in the CityU Information Services Strategic Plan 2005 2010  Office of the CIO  2005   in the next five years the University will strive to provide the access to scholarly information in electronic and print format in a timely manner  One way to realize the goal is to effectively capture  preserve and disseminate the scholarly outputs of the University  Building an institutional repository brings other benefits  IR can  i  provide a new publishing paradigm for the scholars and  ii  increase the visibility and prestige of the institution  Crow  2002   For the first one  IR provides a digital platform for publishing preprints  post prints  working papers  technical reports  conference papers and other kinds of intellectual outputs  The publishing process also helps to secure intellectual property by establishing priority registration of ideas  For the second one  the strength of the scholarship of an institution can be showcased in the repository  By exposing its content to the Internet via OAI PMH protocol 2 the metadata of the documents in IR can be searched globally  Gibbons 2004a    2  Open Archives Initiative   Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  OAI PMH   http   www openarchives org    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  4 2 Systems Evaluation In 2004  the Library formed the IR task force  Members came from Reference  Circulation  Law and Systems  The task force studied and compared common open source systems  A number of good references have been provided by Crow  2002b   Gibbons  2004b  2004c   and the Budapest OAI Guide  2004   Combining with local needs  the Library summarized that the CityU IR should meet the following functional requirements  1  2  3  4  5  6   It can support Chinese  It should be OAI PMH compliant to allow harvesting  It should provide an administrative interface for data input and statistics reports  Its metadata set is flexible enough to describe existing and future digital collections  It allows customization in interface and source  It can be set up and supported by the library with minimal cost   After careful evaluation  the Library chose DSpace as the IR platform as it fulfilled all the requirements  DSpace is an open source software jointly developed by MIT and Hewlett Packard  It runs on Tomcat web server  PostgreSQL database system  JSP and Java 3 4 3 Technical Configurations and CJK Searching Issues CityU IR runs on DSpace  As of May 2006  the DSpace version used is 1 3 2  It is built on Linux Enterprise running Tomcat 5 Standalone  The physical server is an Intel Pentium 4 2 8 GHz with 1 GB RAM  DSpace is built on Java  It can support Unicode  However  the original Java source in DSpace does not tokenize the Chinese characters correctly  As a result  searching of Chinese fails  To solve the problem  the Java class enabling the correct tokenization of Chinese characters is downloaded from the Web before software compilation 4 It is hoped that in the future release of the software the correct Java class will be included in the source code package  4 4 Current Collections in IR CityU IR was launched in February 2006  The home page is http   dspace cityu edu hk   It forms part of the CityU Library Digital Initiatives  http   www cityu edu hk lib digital    Current collections in the IR have an emphasis on student works  They include the followings  Outstanding Academic Papers by Students  OAPS  This is a collection of outstanding academic papers written by students  The scope includes term papers  term projects  case studies  reports and publications of different courses and levels  Papers are selected by academic departments  Student Works with External Awards This is a collection of awards won by CityU students participated in external contests and competitions  Many awards were results of keen competitions organized by prestigious societies and 3 4  DSpace Home  http   www dspace org   The Java class DSTokenizer java that can tokenize Chinese characters correctly is available from the Apache Jakarta

clippings  Undergraduate Final Year Projects This is a collection of final year projects undertaken by undergraduate students for fulfilling their degree requirements  The project reports are selected and submitted to the Library by the departments  Theses and Dissertations This is the new E theses collection  It contains digitized theses and dissertations of CityU students  Other collections under development include research outputs by academic departments   5  E THESES IN CITYU IR 5 1 Why Migrated E theses To IR When it comes to select a platform for E theses  there can be three options  a  Develop one s own system  b  Modify from an E thesis specific software  c  Build from a generic software platform  CityU rejected option  a  in the early stage because of the lack of technical support and of the feeling that it is not wise to re invent the wheel  Software in option  b  usually contains a submission module  More sophisticated software include a workplace for the advisor to supervise  accept or reject the submission  Thesis specific software also includes specific metadata set  for example  an  advisor  field  a  degree  field  or a  defense date  field  A frequently used software of this type is Virginia Tech s open source software ETD db 5 Software in option  c  is not designed specifically for theses  Instead it is a generic solution for archiving and distributing miscellaneous collections  Good examples are DSpace and Eprints 6 When choosing a platform for E theses  one can also ask the following questions  1  Does it need to include an online submission module  Is a workplace for supervising and approval necessary  How can the submission module be integrated into the existing practice and regulations of the graduate school  2  Is a thesis specific metadata set necessary  Would it be an hindrance or a convenience for information interchange  Should the specific metadata be conformed to some standard like the ETD MS  ETD Metadata Standard  of NTLTD 7  5  ETD db Home  http   scholar lib vt edu ETD db  Eprints Home  http   www eprints org  7 Electronic Theses and Dissertations   Metadata Standard  ETD MS   http   www ndltd org standards metadata current html 6   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Jones  2003  ran a detail study comparing ETD db and DSpace  He concluded that a direct comparison is hard as each package is driven by different motivations  However  they chose DSpace in the Thesis Alive  project  8 as DSpace is a better supported package in terms of data structure  security  administration and future expansion  What can be added is  the fact that the ETD MS schema supported by ETD db is not totally OAI compliant may create an obstacle in metadata harvesting  CityU Library chose to migrate E theses to CityU IR for the following reasons  1  DSpace IR is OAI PMH complaint  It is ready to expose the records to harvesting engines in the Internet  2  By publicizing the theses in the Internet  more authors of the past would be likely to grant the access rights to digitize and distribute their theses  3  E theses in CityU emphasizes on post submission workflow  there is no demand for paper authoring and supervision  If such needs arise  submission add on like Tapir can be evaluated  4  Record is assigned with persistent identifier  CNRI handle   this provides long term reference to the materials  5  Grouping theses together with other student works under IR enables a one stop search for all quality student works  This provides a unified platform to showcase the academic achievements of students  6  Strategically  by adding thousands of thesis records to the content  it provide a fast start up to the growth of IR  and to gain recognition from other academic communities of the university  5 2 Metadata In E theses As OAI PMH only supports the Dublin Core metadata schema  non DC elements are avoided when defining new metadata  If needed  new metadata elements are added as qualified DC elements 9 Table 1 lists the metadata elements in the E theses in IR   8 9  Thesis Alive  at Edinburgh University Library  http   www thesesalive ac uk  However  since only unqualified DC elements are supported by OAI PMH  qualified DC will be flattened to unqualified DC when being harvested  as a result  useful field information may become lost    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les

link to record in online catalog CNRI handle  5 3 Migration Process and Current State As online catalog records for theses already exist  there is no need to re input records in DSpace  The migration process includes the following steps   i  MARC records are exported from the catalog   ii  A conversion program will map and convert the MARC tags to Dublin Core elements in XML format   iii  Chinese characters are converted from internal diacritic codes  EACC  to Unicode UTF 8 for storing into DSpace 10  iv  New metadata fields will be added  These include a  department  field to describe the academic department where the degree was earned  a  degree  field and an  abstract  field   v  The Dublin Core XML records will be imported into DSpace using the import utility  It turns out that adding the abstract field is the most time consuming job as it involves running OCR on over 2 500 previously scanned PDF files  It is expected that the OCR job will be finished in June 2006 and the migration work be completed in July  5 4 Hierarchy Of E theses Collections In IR The E theses in DSpace are organized in a hierarchy of community  sub communities and collections  The top community is Electronic Theses and Dissertations  Under the top community  there are subcommunities created for departments  Under each sub community  there are collections created for degrees  Ph D   M Phil   M A   M Sc  etc    Figure 2   10  In MARC 21 specification  Chinese characters are encoded in the EACC  East Asian Coded Character  set    9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  Figure 2  Community  sub communities and collections in new E theses  The nice thing about DSpace is that one can have an item appears in more than one collection  If a new community is created for an academic department  a thesis or dissertation can be mapped back to its degree granting department  By providing cross mapping  a user can search a thesis item by starting from either the owning community of the thesis or from the departmental community   Figure 3    Cross linked between collections  Figure 3  Theses items mapped between collections   5 5 Access Rights   9th International Symposium on Electronic Theses and Dissertations IXe Symposium international sur les theses et memoires electroniques June 7   10 Juin  2006  Quebec City   Quebec  Canada  As most existing theses were submitted before the electronic submission requirements issued in 2004  due to unclear access right policies in the past  a number of theses can not be opened for academic exchange or for the public  To obtain permission from authors  in 2005 the Library sent letters to alumni to ask for approval  The response rate was not satisfactory  About one third had returned  The Library will spend more effort to contact the alumni again  By providing a publishing platform in IR  it is likely that more authors will agree to grant rights to digitize and distribute their theses  5 6 Future Enhancements Submission of theses and dissertations are currently managed by the School of Graduate Studies for research postgraduate degrees and by individual departments for taught postgraduate degrees  Electronic copies in PDF format are passed to the Library  To automate the submission process  an online submission module can be added  Such module can provide file uploading function and simple metadata input interface for the academic units  A more advanced submission module will include a supervised authority facility allowing the supervisors to observe the ongoing work and to approve or reject the project online  Adoption of such advanced module requires changes in the submission policy in the academic units  At current there is no such demand in CityU  An example of the advanced submission module is the Tapir Project developed by the University of Edinburgh  11  Andrew 2004  Another possible feature to be added is full text searching  However  as the electronic requirement is new and most of the old theses are digitized from print copy  full text searching for all can not be provided yet   6  CONCLUSION The Library is in the process of migrating the E theses collection from the old browsing interface to the CityU IR developed in DSpace  There are many advantages of relocating E theses to the new home  Records can be harvested by Internet engines easily via OAI  Research outputs of students will be more visible  Searching and display of records are enhanced  Authors of the old theses will be likely to grant access rights to the Library once their theses are published in a more visible platform  All quality student works can be searched in a single platform  Lastly  by adding E theses into IR  it provides a boost to the content of IR  The increased usage and collections will help to promote IR to other academic communities of the University   7  REFERENCES Andrew  T   2004   Theses Alive    an E theses management system for the UK  Available at  http   hdl handle net 1842 423  accessed 23 May 2006   Budapest
